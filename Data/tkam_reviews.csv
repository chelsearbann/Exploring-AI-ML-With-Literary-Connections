 It shows the human contradicting nature. 
 I don't think I hate to recap the values in it. It's been told many times. 
 A good book to read, a wonderful perspective to see from. 
 And in all, the story is alive. You cannot not live with it. 
 I guess if I have to say what I like, I wouldn't be able to say it. 
 Many times I feel that I can argue with the contents but in the end, it shoots right back at me. 
 They are not all right, nor am I all wrong. 
 But there's only reality and a wide view in which one cannot state his like or dislikes. 
 I have to stay and think for a while to come up for a better review. 
 But for now, this is it.","Thu Nov 15 01:50:50 -0800 2012","Sat Dec 15 21:31:08 -0800 2012","Sat Dec 15 00:00:00 -0800 2012","Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 -0800 2012",0,0

I'm not a big fan of classics, thinking them outdated and hard to read but this novel was satisfying. It was a bit slow at the start, and then there was this sequence of seemingly random events through the novel, which confused me. But then I started to realize they were all symbolic events and they really drove the point forwards- of the inequality of the American South and the African Americans. I also really like the attitude of the Finches, especially that of Atticus Finch who has some pretty remarkable quotes in there.","Wed Nov 07 03:26:39 -0800 2012","Sat Jun 29 20:22:34 -0700 2013","","Mon Feb 04 00:00:00 -0800 2013",5,0

I've always meant to read it but never had, but the audiobook version I listened to on my way home to visit family was excellent. The voice of Scout was well-chosen and all those country sayings had a lot of flavor when read aloud. The story is one that many better than I have critiqued, so I will say that it made me feel lots of feelings and feel glad that I don't live in that time. Though there are people of the future who will feel that way about our present and be glad they didn't live now for the very same reasons. Our prejudice may not be as blatant now, but it still exists and influences everyday life. What I found most awful was the fact that every single person in Scout's story seemed to have a prejudice against someone. The worst said it loudly and proudly, some said it while trying to help the less fortunate and patronizingly, some thought they weren't prejudiced (like Scout and Jim), but they had all those notions about Boo Radley. I think Atticus is the best person in the story, but even he had some prejudices against womenfolk and how they shouldn't be on a jury since they'd interrupt all the time. Everyone in town had someone to look down on. 
 Scout's teacher getting mad at her for reading incorrectly made me mad and then it was so ridiculous I had to giggle. I guess similar educational decisions throughout history have been just as silly. Hopefully they haven't been harmful, but I loved what Scout said about school and it is a good reminder to teachers that no matter what, we should make sure that this isn't what our kids are thinking! As I inched sluggishly along the treadmill of the Maycomb County school system, I could not help receiving the impression that I was being cheated out of something. Out of what, I knew not. Yet I did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom was exactly what the state had in mind for me. 
 It was adorable that when Scout felt neglected by her 'future husband', Dill, she said she beat him up twice but it did no good. he he he. 
 Sometimes the Bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand of your father. 
 There are just some kind of men who are so busy worrying about the next world they've never learned to live in this one. 
 The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience. 
 The scene in front of the door of the jail was horrifying and the fact that an innocent girl's questions and conversation was the only thing that saved everyone from violence was awful. The mob mentality described was spot on. 
 All the little man on the witness stand had that made him any better than his nearest neighbors was that if scrubbed with lye soap and very hot water, his skin was white. 
 We're so rarely called on to be Christians, but when we are, we've got men like Atticus to go for us. 
 I thought Dill's idea about becoming a clown since he thought he couldn't do anything about the people being crappy so he might as well laugh at them. 
 The absolute hypocrisy of the people being upset about the persecution of the Jews in Europe while they stepped all over the black people here at home was maddening. I want to go back in time and ask how the hell they reconciled that in their brains. 
 The discussion of why some families were better than others between the kids was funny and insightful. They couldn't figure out why some families were older than others if they all had ancestors anyway. Aunt Alexandra's insistence that their family was old and better than others was confusing to them. They conclude that all the families are alike, but then wonder why they all hate each other if that is true. Then Jim sums it up by saying he understands why Boo Radley stayed inside his house all the time. (To stay away from the awful humans all around him). 
 I thought the description of the society of ladies was spot-on. The ladies all had an air of quiet and respect but sat there making scathing comments couched in innocent conversation that was just as biting as the out-right insults that the men used. Scout preferred the forthrightness of the men since it got out there and then the subsequent fight would settle things. 
 In the secret courts of men's hearts, Atticus had no case. Tom was a dead man the minute Mayella Ewell opened her mouth and screamed.","Tue Sep 23 16:36:03 -0700 2014","Fri Aug 11 11:22:03 -0700 2017","Fri Aug 11 11:22:04 -0700 2017","",0,0

Jem and Scout are growing up without their mother, but surrounded by caring neighbors. When their father Atticus is assigned to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman, their lives are changed forever. Harper Lee is a gifted storyteller. Her sentences are so beautifully written and so layered. Her sense of humor is acute and Scout's voice is especially precocious and charming. I can't imagine getting tired of this book, ever. Every time I read it, I get something new out of it. Reading it with my son was a great experience. He often wanted to stop and discuss issues that came up in the book, and it added a lot to the experience. He did make fun of me a little when I cried at the end.

I especially loved the second half; the court case was so interesting and brilliantly written. I would love to study this book and really analyse it as it covers so many important topics, ranging from racism, social class divides and injustice within society in southern America in the 1960's. The story is told both from a child's perspective (Scout) which gives an innocence and naivety to situations, but also from Scout reflecting on the events as an adult. The characters are extremely endearing and likeable and the acts of bravery they displayed were heart warming.

What I loved about this book is Atticus' defending a black man, but the story doesn't revolve around that fact. . .even though it is the major event that caused all the chaos. Reading the book from a child's point of view made just that much more interesting. The ending was perfect. . .""He would be there all night, and he would be there when Jem waked up in the morning.""

 Although the prejudices and injustices seem antedeluvian now it is worth bearing in mind that, when the book (and superb film) came out in the early 1960s, James Stewart (the great fair minded movie hero himself),apparently turned down the role of Atticus because he felt the part represented too liberal a viewpoint.","Sun Mar 30 04:50:59 -0700 2008","Mon Mar 22 08:35:07 -0700 2010","Thu Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 1976","",0,0

 This book is not boring. It is awesome. The characters are all very well developed and likable, the theme rings true, and the narrative voice is simply beautiful to read. I gobbled it right up and couldn't stop reading, even though I probably wasn't supposed to read ahead in class. 
 The only problem I can see with it is that it's not very strong on plot. There are two plots that aren't really connected until the end. Though the story is very engaging, not all the parts are entirely connected to each other. But I don't necessarily think the book would have been better if it was more plot focused.

Anyway, To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the most dreaded books to read in high school (not to mention Lord of the Flies, which I will never reviewed because I already read it a long time ago. I don't review books I read a long time ago unless people ask me politely). Most students wouldn't even read the first page of the book, for the fear of reading a dull and obnoxious books. (Like Treasure Island [I fell asleep on that one]). After 50 years plus after the date of publishing, I'm confused why To Kill A Mockingbird would be on the list of required reading. (And hey, lazy high school kids? I might slip some answers you're looking for in your direction.) 
 Even though the main character is Scout Finch, we are focused on Atticus Finch, who is Scout's somewhat distant father. Scout's mother died when she was younger, therefore only briefly mentioned by Scout. Cal, the Finch's housekeeper, fills in the role. Scout is used to the racial slurs and bad words and the gossip that surrounds the town. Although Scout is used to the areas and words of Maycomb, she's quite ignorant in the ways of the Great Depression. (I suspect she knows nothing about it.) 
 The term ""Mockingbird"" is first mentioned by Atticus Finch to mentions something along the line that to kill mockingbird is a sin. However, it was Miss. Maurie who actually explained the meaning of the mockingbird in full terms. (I believe that's somewhere in part one.) To kill a mockingbird is to destroy the goodness and beauty of _____. Obviously, the mockingbird is a symbol of a person, but whom is the question? There's several candidates for the role. The major players in line are Tom Robinson and Boo Radley. Tom, because he did nothing but help a white women do her chores out of the sorry and goodness from his heart. (Robinson died in the end). And Boo, who gave the children (Jem and Scout) gifts and protected them when they needed him. Atticus Finch also is an excellent candidate for the symbol, but his evidence isn't as big as Robinson's or Radley's. (Don't forget about his last name, Finch, which is a bird. Perhaps another hint-hint from the author?) 
 As time goes on, we see major changes in Jem, Scout, and Dill. Jem and Scout matures the most in the book. Jem, with his old memories of his lost mother, is somewhat softer and more empathic about other people than Scout. He's able to understand other people, which makes him more mature in ways that are different from Scout. Dill is the innocent child, the one with penchants for tall tales and ridiculous stories. (Remember, his story of running from home?) Dill is the outsider of the trio. He's not a native to Maycomb so he doesn't understand the POV of someone who comes from Maycomb. (Evidence: Jem tries to explain to Dill about the personalities and characteristics of Maycomb citizens in the beginning of To Kill A Mockingbird.) 
 Then there's Scout, who has the biggest change of all. Remember Walter Cunningham in the beginning of the novel? Remember Scout's distaste and protests about Walter's table manners because she doesn't understand why Walter does that? (Walter, by the way, pours syrup all over his food because syrup is a luxury in his poor family. He's unused to fine food.) By the end of the book, she able to understand Boo's personality and mind. (Boo, by the way, is the most mysterious character pretty much all of Maycomb.) 
 Maycomb is a Southern town located in US. Obviously the Civil War made a huge effect on the people and and their children and their children's children. Racism, prejudice, and the no-censorship on any cussing words like ""whore lady"" are part of Maycom, but is not the biggest part of the novel, other than prejudice, which had a huge effect on the Tom Robinson v. Ewells case. 
 I know I went through this book in great detail, but I can't figure out why people like this book so much. 50 years is a long time running, but I don't get why people like To Kill a Mockingbird. Maybe because it's the same problem as Scout Finch, the inability to walk in other people's shoes. I don't know why people like To Kill A Mockingbird. To me, this book is a boring waste of time and in depth reading.

 Sure, that's what I'd like to believe. There are so many stories of wonderful white folks saving the oppressed peoples of the world. But mostly, people didn't. Those whites who didn't attend lynchings as if they were family outings enjoyed their privileged and mostly didn't fight the system on principle, or religion, or any other basis. My parents didn't use racial slurs, but they never entertained a person of color in their home until I had all my female classmates over for a party in sixth grade.

 Through the mind of our six year old protagonist 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is the story of a little town called Maycomb, relaying the prejudice and injustice that prevails. Sewn in this tale is the eccentrics of the town people and the endearing relations Scout has with them. Thought-provoking as well as heart-tugging, it is the classic everyone deems it to be 
 It is the book that is on everyone's favourite bookshelf, the book they rave about, the book they exclaim when I say I haven't read it and it is also my mother's favourite book. So thus it is with a load of expectation that I started the book, a load much heavier than the text of the book. 
 Had the book been exactly what I had been expecting I would have probably been disappointed. But it suprised me with the chapters solely devoted to the lives and mayhem the kids cause over summer and their school experiences. This brought me closer to the characters. 
 My mother was probably watching me like a hawk while reading it, and every time she asked me how I like it so far? I would say it's nice and ask when the whole court scene is gonna happen. She would say a long time after. So it is when I stopped waiting for some eye-opener that I began to enjoy this simple story. 
 The court scene was everything it was built up for. And once I stopped flinching every-time I read the N word, I throughly enjoyed it. 
 I fell in love with all the characters, they seemed so very real. 
 The 0.5 stars reduction is not the fault of the book, it is the brunt of the expectations load still looming over.","Tue Aug 21 06:43:49 -0700 2012","Mon Aug 19 21:56:11 -0700 2013","Sun Jul 28 00:00:00 -0700 2013","Fri Jul 26 00:00:00 -0700 2013",8,7

It's one of the American classics and it's mandatory reading in high-school. There's 70000 written reviews about this book on Goodreads alone. Another review would just be a drop in the bucket, so most of all I'm going to put down my thoughts for my own future self to refer to. 
 ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" wasn't something I'd read in my school (I'm not in the US), but heard mentioned time and again, it being regarded as one of the greatest novels of all time and all that. In my effort to beat my 2017 reading challenge, I took on this book at long last. 
 I honestly didn't know much about the actual story and genre of TKaM and was pleasantly surprised to find out it's all set in Depression Era USA. I'd previously read and loved Gone with the Wind, and also East of Eden. There's something inherently interesting to me about this time period and place. 
 In TKaM, you follow two years of childhood life of little Jean-Louise ""Scout"" Finch, who lives with her 4 year older brother Jeremy and dad Atticus who is a lawyer. I didn't know where the story would lead for the entire first half, as it had such a slice-of-life kind of flow. Scout talks about one minor event after the other. Stuff like how she, her brother and close friend would reenact stories from books or get into trouble with her teacher on the first day of school. 
 Throughout that first half, there's a building up of the mystery of a certain ""Boo"" Radley, a neighbor who stayed in his house and was never seen. The mystery and small-town-creepiness feeling was very strong and you'd get really into the head of a small child. You remember when you were a kid and the littlest things could take on huge significance in your impressionable mind? That's exactly how I felt reading TKaM and that's a testament to the strength of Harper Lees writing. Even though the mystery was probably nothing much in actuality, it evoked a constant sense of dread while reading. I half-expected TKaM to be the typical (or original?) story of a peaceful small town hiding a sinister secret under its idyllic veneer. 
 There's also something about viewing the world from the POV of an intelligent child that's always interesting, something I found when reading Ender's Game for example. It's a great tool for elegantly exposing the idiocy of most adults without being preachy. 
 I was pleasantly surprised when in the second half it turns out that TKaM was actually more about the ugliness that stares society square in the face all the time - racism and adult hypocrisy. It is here that the character of Atticus Finch really shines. Atticus is a great parent, one who not only preaches a good message (always be kind to others, etc) but who actively practices it. He places his trust in his children and doesn't patronize them. That's very much in contrast to parents you see in life all the time who think they're being kind and loving when they're actually soft and weak about guiding their children, but I digress. 
 Atticus becomes more and more impressive a character who just drops truth-bombs and deep wisdom on his kids that are truly important to think about for the readers, not just the children. I realized that the point of the story wasn't the Radley mystery, the courtroom drama or the final incident, but the conduct and philosophy of Atticus Finch throughout the story. He is not unfailing, if you wondered about that, but just a man who tries his best all of the time considering the circumstances and that's more than you can say of 90% of people in real life. TKaM then is a book about inspiring people to think more and be more courageous, and that's why it is such an important novel, a timeless classic chock-full of lessons for people everywhere. 
 I'll just include a wonderful little paragraph: 
 ""Lemme tell you somethin' now, Billy,"" a third said, ""you know the court appointed him to defend this nigger."" 
 ""Yeah, but Atticus aims to defend him. That's what I don't like about it."" 
 This was news, news that put a different light on things: Atticus had to, whether he wanted to or not. I thought it odd that he hadn't said anything to us about it--we could have used it many times in defending him and ourselves. He had to, that's why he was doing it, equaled fewer fights and less fussing. But did that explain the town's attitude? The court appointed Atticus to defend him. Atticus aimed to defend him. That's what they didn't like about it. It was confusing.","Fri Aug 12 02:53:22 -0700 2016","Wed Mar 15 23:15:12 -0700 2017","Tue Mar 14 01:08:32 -0700 2017","Wed Mar 01 00:00:00 -0800 2017",1,0

 And I really did love it. It was one of the few books that I studied in school and still liked by the end of the term, although having to study it took some of the enjoyment out of it, for me. 
 Scout is a wonderful narrator. And Atticus Finch is such a wonderful character name, and god damn I wish I had thought of it. I think I'll be jealous of that (in the best way) for the rest of my life. 
 This book, though. It's a very humble little book, that did many great things. I would love to reread this book because I know there are a lot of subtleties in it, and I'd love to experience those again and maybe pick up on something new. This book builds very quietly, but it's a fantastic, very neat little piece of literature and it should never go out of print. 
 If you haven't read it because you didn't get to it in school and you've been putting it off for whatever reason - now is your chance because there's a sequel coming out, and that's awesome as well. I am excited for that! 
 ... EDIT: I just reread the book, and, like a lot of other people rereading it, I encountered so much I had forgotten and fell in love with it all over again. I cried a lot more than I thought I would and found it an absolutely worthwhile reread. It's so cool to be rereading this book along with a bunch of other likeminded people who are all also keen to check out the sequel. 
 It was nice to be back in Maycomb County, I love Harper Lee's writing, and I can't wait to read Go Set a Watchman. 
 YET ANOTHER EDIT: 
 After seeing some reviews of this book, and of the sequel (or prequel?) Go Set a Watchman, I've begun to rethink my relationship with it. 
 I see now, that Harper Lee, while addressing racism in a wonderful way through the perspectives of children, does, to a degree, silence the struggle, the strength and the resistance black people had in that time in towns like Maycomb County. This story, like a lot of others, falls prey to a lot of racist micro-aggressions that we all fall prey to, to this day. 
 The characters are well-written, and it's a powerful story, but I feel like this book would be a lot more powerful if we heard parts of the story from Tom Robinson's or Cal's perspective. Atticus Finch himself admits that he is not a radical man and while positioned as a good lawyer, isn't necessarily a good person, willing to change the structure of the town. 
 (There's more on him over here that I greatly agree with. http://academicfeminist.tumblr.com/po...) 
 Scout and Jem Finch are uncomfortable with racism and so perhaps they will be the first to change the way society works in Maycomb County. This is a well-written story, as I said, and I am grateful that Lee wrote it, with all the challenges she must've faced writing it, and getting it published. 
 That said, I cannot, in my heart, hold this book up on a pedestal as the be all and end all of atypical books that combat racism. I need to read more Alice Walker, more Toni Morrison, more James Baldwin, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Maya Angelou, Roxane Gay, Octavia E. Butler, Zora Neale Hurtson, Angela Davis, Gloria Naylor, Jacqueline Woodson, Richard Wright, Langston Hughes and so, so, so many more authors who spoke directly to the black experience and to marginalised people everywhere, looking for hope.

 I did enjoy it, I really did. It was just really hard for me to push myself through this one, and I found myself getting bored fairly often. While some parts were 5 stars, other parts I didn't feel were necessary in order to make the story progress. I think that if I re-read it (and read it slower) I might enjoy it a bit more, but for now, this is where I stand.

Reading it now brings back memories of summer days, where time was seemingly endless in its plodding, and the humid heat necessitated escape via swimming pools and lemonade. The south of my childhood was considerably less fraught with issues than in those years between 1930-1960, but it's obvious remnants of the civil rights issues are (frustratingly, heartbreakingly) present and relevant today. 
 Harper Lee captures so much about small town rural America in those years. The flaws and social issues, not just between races, but gender inequality, the reality of poverty and education shortcomings as well. This fits with stories my dad told me from his youth on a rural Georgia farm- where racism was simply a part of every day life, where crosses burned on the hill across from his house some nights, and people looked the other way. Where high schools were segregated and alcoholism lived side by side with church on Sundays. 
 This is a story that's aged gracefully in the 50(-ish) years since its been written.

One thing is, its not a light read. While reading this book I found myself, keeping it down for a while and thinking about something that Scout, Jem or Atticus would have said; which in itself is an achievement for usually I can't wait to get to the end. 
 One line in particular has stuck with me is a Atticus telling his son, Jem 'You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb into their skin and walk around in it.' 
 The book has a deceptively simple narrative. It is story told by a 9 year old girl about life with her father(a Lawyer) and her brother, Jim. The kids, grow up, trying to understand people and their various quirks. 
 Although the main theme is racism, apathy and hypocrisy, it comes across as much more than that. It is a story of a father trying to raise his children without any kind of prejudice; a story that shows not everyone is good, but that doesn't mean we have to hate them. We just need to understand them a little better. 
 Atticus has become one of my favourite character now. His wisdom and odd ways makes him so endearing and I just had to let him adopt me as his daughter. He becomes the epitome of empathy and bravery. He is also a man, who would not be browbeaten and stands up against almost everyone in town for what he believes is an injustice. He shows braveness is a measure of character than about how many fights you pick. 
 Overall, I'd give the author a big whooping FIVE for her characters, prose, plot and especially for her not so happy ending.","Wed Mar 06 23:23:21 -0800 2013","Wed Nov 27 09:01:41 -0800 2013","Wed Nov 27 09:01:41 -0800 2013","Wed Nov 27 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,0

 When I first (?) read this book ten years ago I didn't care for it. (Yes, I do know that the idea is heresy.) It's not a YA book and I was reading it to be taught to poor and non-readers in ninth grade. (I wasn't teaching the class; I have taught Kindred by Octavia Butler on racism instead, among others.) 
 Oh, I like the movie, but the book meanders around to spend chapters on Miss Maudie, Miss Stephanie, Mrs. Dubose, people who are entirely tangential to the primary plot. I would have preferred this as a short story or novella, instead of a novel. I've requested the play from the library, if it's a more straightforward telling of the story and I assume it is, I'll direct it next year. 
 Instead of Atticus Finch's children's POV, I would have preferred this book was told from Tom Robinson's children. But fifty years ago that book wouldn't have changed society as this one did. This book laid the way for the Civil Rights Act, probably helped to integrate schools as much as Brown, and has made our society more fair and equal. I'm leading a discussion of the book next week at the library, in part, as a response to my Village's ex-mayor and still Supervisor's racist words. And, like those men, many of the people in this novel use the n-word casually and that also makes this a difficult read. My thoughts are not terribly coherent yet on this book, and for that I apologize. 
 My thoughts on the book in April '11... 
 I saw things in this fourth or fifth reading I'd forgotten or overlooked. Reading it as a supplement to the play, while directing the play is a huge help. It's a Cunningham family member who is on the jury and keeps it out so long. I am again glad that in the play Atticus doesn't call Mrs. Dubose the bravest person he's ever known. But knowing that Mr. Underwood had his shotgun out during the mob scene makes Atticus seem more prepared.","Wed Sep 17 12:12:06 -0700 2008","Wed Apr 20 10:50:56 -0700 2011","Thu Aug 12 00:00:00 -0700 2010","",0,0

 I loved this book. I read it a few years ago when my older son was reading it in 9th grade. And I listened to it again last week. It is a deeply moving and often troubling story. It is full of thought and heart. It is a coming of age story of a girl in the deep South who is surrounded by the vile world of prejudice, but who is raised by an open-minded and open-hearted father. The messages and themes of this book are many... all of them important. It is a book that will linger in your thoughts. It is a book that will touch your heart. And it is a book that everyone should read. Once. More than once is even better! 
 This quote shares the message that I may like best. ""I have always believed, and I still believe, that whatever good or bad fortune may come our way we can always give it meaning and transform it into something of value.""

I don't actually think I'm capable of saying anything that hasn't already been said by people who said it better than I ever could. I feel like the only way this book can be reviewed now is either by looking at it through the context of today's societal lens, or by relating it to the reader's personal experience. I'm going to take the latter route, and even then, I'm going to keep it brief because words are wind and carry no meaning. 
 Well, that last part I'm sort of being facetious about (I am a writer writing things, this, for example), but I feel it's true in this case. Too much stuff to pack into one review. 
 I have now read this book three times: 
 Once in the eighth grade. We read it out loud in class. I remember knowing it was an important book at the time. I also remembering not really understanding why it was important. Everything in it seemed pretty obvious to me. My general reaction was along the lines of 'Hey this is a thing, moving on now.' 
 Once ten years ago. I was gobsmacked at my earlier self's reaction. This was a really good book! This was one of my earliest memories of re-experiencing literature as an adult, and one of the main reasons I'm bent on re-reading classics I read as a teenager when I was too young to appreciate them. 
 And now, when I am convinced this is one of the finest books ever written. It's simple and straightforward, yet it packs a mean punch. And at its core are things that have (sadly) only gotten more relevant with time. 
 My biggest takeaway this time is that the book is also more complex than I remembered. It's not A BOOK ABOUT RACE, although that is part of it. It's more like the racism is a symptom of a larger problem: a lack of empathy, a loss of innocence, where innocence is the ability to see past socially constructed boundaries, and human compassion is the exception not the rule. That's why Scout is the narrator, and Jem is the key to the story. At the beginning of the novel, Jem is like Scout, thinking ""folks is just folks,"" and by the end he's sad and bitter, and trying to work out in his head how it is that if folks are just folks, how the world can be the way it is. And how he has to learn to become like his father Atticus, a man who sees how people behave in groups, how they adhere so rigidly to how things are instead of how they should be, and who still believes that most people are nice ""when you finally see them."" All of these are sentiments I was completely unable to appreciate as a still-innocent, completely idealistic pre-teen. And even on my second read, I didn't have enought life experience to really get it. 
 This is going to be one of those books, like Lord of the Rings, that I bust out every ten years and marvel anew how good it is, and fall in love with the more I read it. I'm cautiously excited for Go Set a Watchman this summer, despite the controversy.

 Since then, this book has always been one of my favorite novels. The story brings up issues of racism through the eyes of a child, and that was something I had never read before. Sure, I always find Tom Robinson's trial riveting, and the mystery of Boo Radley constantly intrigues me - and that will never change. And whenever I recall the story, I can't help but admire Atticus Finch as a father. He never has a bad word to say about anyone and leads by example. It's easy to talk a good game, but his actions show that he is a compassionate, caring and conscientious person. He also has a fantastic relationship with his children, Scout and Jem, and treats them with respect.

When we decided to pick To Kill a Mockingbird for my book club, I thought ""Good, I haven't read it in ages!"". But when I started reading it, I quickly realised that I actually never had before. I might have watched the film, and I have certainly read many a discussion about it, but this was my first proper read of the book, and it was an interesting experience. 
 I read it in May, long before Go Set A Watchman came out, and intended to post a review before then. I made my usual disjointed notes as soon as I finished it, but then I hit a really busy patch in the last few months and all blogging went out the window. It would be pretty much impossible to write a review now that's not coloured by what I've heard about Watchman, so what I'll do is to simply copy those few notes (with some minor edits for grammar and readability -they really were disjointed!) below and be done with it: 
 - I didn't expect the humour. There were scenes that had me laughing out loud, like Scout's first teacher and the ladies' tea party. 
 - The characters, even many of the secondary ones, are so well-realised that I could see the events in this book being written from several points of view. The story would then be about something else, though. Which might not be a bad thing... 
 - From all I knew about it, I expected the book to be about Tom Robinson's case and the trial. It wasn't. It was about Scout and Jem growing up and understanding the world they're living in. Tom Robinson's story was unimportant, other than as an example of injustice. The whole point of it was to be the catalyst for Scout and Jem's coming of age. Very uncomfortable about that. Feels like when the whole point of a disabled character is to change the life of the able-bodied protagonist, that sort of thing. 
 - This reminded me of Lean In, in that it seems to be all about learning to live in a fundamentally unfair, imperfect system and how to manipulate it to get a little bit of justice. I lost a lot of respect for Atticus for seeing enough value in the system to want to continue living in it, to think it was worth the effort. Probably immature of me. I wanted him to want to change the system. I wanted him to recognise that a system that works as his society did has no value. I wanted him to want to say ""fuck the system"" and want to tear it down and burn it to pieces. Because that society? That's what should have happened to it. And someone who would be part of a lynch mob is not ""basically a good man"", just with some blind spots. I found that attitude really troubling. 
 MY GRADE: It feels like sacrilege, but although I recognise how good a writer Lee was and I enjoyed the story while I was reading it, too much about it bothered me. It was a B for me.","Thu Apr 23 05:06:51 -0700 2015","Sat Aug 15 02:45:26 -0700 2015","Sun May 10 00:00:00 -0700 2015","Thu Apr 23 00:00:00 -0700 2015",0,0

 For a long time now, To Kill a Mockingbird has been one of the most glaring omissions of my reading life. Everybody but me seems to have read it and loved it. So I'm glad I've finally checked it off. 
 For the first twenty or thirty pages, I was quite impressed. The prose was warm and lively; the characters, well-realized and likable. The episodic quality of the plot did bore me a little, but the opening scenes were, for the most part, charming. 
 But the more I read, the less I enjoyed. Until the Tom Robinson trial, nothing propelled me forward. The characters are simple enough to understand in two pages, and nothing exciting happens in their young lives. So when people finally started giving Jem and Scout trouble about the Tom Robinson case, I was pleased. Finally, some direction. 
 This, however, is when the book went from charming to nauseating for me. I fear that my criticism will not be pleasing to many; but if there's one place in the world to express your honest opinions about a book, it's a Goodreads review. 
 It comes down to this: To Kill a Mockingbird is a boring book. And I don't say that because ""nothing cool happens,"" but because the book doesn't make the reader think. Rather, it lulls the reader's intellect to sleep; its appeal is to the heart only--and even then, to the most childish feelings of the heart. 
 Consider the moral universe of To Kill a Mockingbird. It is a world populated by good folks and bad folks. There are no in-between folks. In other words, there are no people. 
 Take Atticus Finch--the hero. The only fictional hero that can rival good ol' Atticus for lack of emotional complexity is Superman. Sure, he's a memorable character; but so are Santa Clause and Bugs Bunny. The reader never understands why Atticus is so righteous, or where he gets his inner strength. Atticus is so upstanding it's impossible even to admire him. I admire Martin Luther King, Jr. because I know that the man must have suffered many crippling moments of doubt and desperation. But Atticus always keeps his cool, always knows what to do, always wants to do the right thing. He's as interesting as a bowl of plain oatmeal. 
 Tom Robinson is even worse. He's the stereotype of the kind-hearted, innocent ""Negro"" who don't want no trouble from no White Folks. He could have been plucked right from the pages of Uncle Tom's Cabin (a book I disliked even more than this one). He couldn't be more two-dimensional if he was a stick figure; he doesn't even reach the status of caricature. That Harper Lee chose to make the book's one tragic figure such a stock character is beyond me. What reader is heartbroken by his death? (This is not to mention that the way Harper Lee kills him off is clumsy and contrived.) 
 I think the main reason this books fails is that it attempts to tackle grown-up issues from the perspective of a naive child. As a result, the solution it offers to the problems of the world--which, in Lee's opinion, could be summed up as ""why people got to be so mean to each other?""--is sickly-sweet sentimentality. In fact, the solution to the questions of racism, oppression, rape, deceit, murder, and all of the other evils of the world, is exactly what a child would give: ""Why can't everyone just be more like my paw?""","Wed May 01 09:02:27 -0700 2013","Tue Jun 07 08:38:05 -0700 2016","Fri Aug 22 00:00:00 -0700 2014","",19,7

I love it just as much now, or maybe even more so, as I did when I read it for the first time in middle school. This book is about the town of Maycomb, Alabama, where a father, Atticus Finch, a local attorney, is assigned by the local court to represent a black man who has allegedly raped a white woman. The narrator, Scout Finch, explains the hardships they had to deal with during this situation. As this novel is set during the Civil Rights Movement, I think this would be an excellent choice to teach because it is also a history lesson as well as a classic tale of sadness, happiness, equality, immaturity and maturity, and injustice and redemption. In addition to that, we get to see a true hero in this novel, Atticus. Throughout their story, we see them struggle and yet continuously do what is right, regardless of how the other people in the town take it. 
 I look forward to the day when I am able to teach this to middle grades students. This will be a great book to introduce theme, symbolism, and motifs as literary devices. I think the themes especially are important lessons to learn from this story. I found that a great activity to do to help kids really connect to the story in their own way is to create a soundtrack involving songs and lyrics that are fitting to the story, characters, tone of a particular section of the book, etc. Also, to keep them engaged in the story, maybe we could do an activity where they choose a character from the story and write diary entries as if they are that character, also while collecting artifacts that the characters would keep and presenting their findings and diary entries. This novel provides excellent characterization which kids would find relatable and interesting. I believe in teaching this book, we will have very productive classes where the kids enjoy coming to class to discuss this novel. Hopefully they will enjoy this novel as much as I have. I see that this novel will greatly resonate with middle school readers. This book definitely has my recommendation and it will be one that I definitely teach one day.","Sat Mar 19 19:43:27 -0700 2011","Sun Aug 13 12:47:40 -0700 2017","","",0,0

 What objections I have are not with the book itself, but with the Finch family as the Moral standard to which America should aspire. The Finches are good people, certainly by the standard of the time and place in which they lived, but they have clear (and likely intentional) moral flaws. They are unapologetically classist, and they are certainly racist. They are of course well intentioned, and their attitudes are certainly preferable to those of the sneering villains and gossiping housewives of the novel, but they are racist nonetheless, in more subtle ways that remind me of the struggles with racism that have dominated the news all too often in our own time. 
 It was fascinating reading this after reading reactions to Atticus' depiction in Go Set a Watchman. I have not read that book (which was apparently an earlier draft of this one), but I don't think Atticus growing more overtly racist in his old is inconsistent with the Atticus of TKaM. 
 Those objections aside, I was pleased with To Kill a Mockingbird as entertainment, and as a revealing depiction of growing up as a young girl in south in the 1930's.","Mon Mar 21 10:58:11 -0700 2016","Wed Mar 30 16:27:06 -0700 2016","Wed Mar 30 16:27:06 -0700 2016","Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 -0700 2016",1,0

My reading of it was spaced out so I couldn't follow the story properly. I abandoned it until I could read it completely and enjoy it. 
 This book is astounding. Not only is it thought provoking and complex, it is also real and so simple. 
 One of my favourite themes in media is the innocence of children and their views - how it comes to our notice that society then shapes our prejudices and ill thought of inequality; children do not care in their naivete and innocent outlook. This book plays strongly on this theme. Its narrator, Scout, is a six-year-old at the beginning of this novel and is not even ten by its end, though she and her brother grow up, and some of that innocence is lost. 
 Throughout the story, the development (or should I say the destruction?) of the children's innocence is played out brilliantly by its believability. With all the fun, happy-go-lucky moments we read about there are also many melancholy moments that appear in the book as the children, and therefore we as readers, come to realisations and acceptances. One stand out point for me was Jem's realisation over Boo Radley wanting to stay indoors - 'it's because he wants to stay inside'. It comes to the cost of accepting what society itself is like. All this time Jem had thought Boo was kept inside because why wouldn't he want to be around people? But Jem accepts, after the trial of Tom Robinson, that it is because of people and how corruptive society can be. Jem's faith in humanity and justice is shaken. As he says himself, 'Why can't they get along with each other?' Many times throughout the book Scout talks of how Jem began to act older. As Jem is pretending to be grown up, it made the utter belief that Atticus would win the court case hurt all that more - because really he is still a child, still an innocent, still not aware how corrupt society really is. 
 Perhaps the scene where Scout cools off the mob at the jail by talking coolly, with innocent, out-of-place questions, is the most memorable for me. Here Scout, in her innocence, her youth, she reminds these men of humanity in their least humane moment, It also reminded me as I read the book that people who act out rashly and do horrible things are sometimes not evil or truly bad, but are capable of humane deeds and can be those normal, everyday folk who would usually be too polite to cause a fuss. 
 How much I recommend it: Anyone who enjoys the themes mentioned will adore this book and will love its message. If Boo Radley doesn't stay in your mind days after reading, if the final scene doesn't replay itself in your head, doesn't mean something to you... then I doubt you read the book. 
 A book like this makes you feel so deeply, ponder on its quotes, its references and the stories of its characters. It was a beautiful, emotional read that will stay with me for a very long time. Possibly forever, till my memory begins to fail me. It's a book that reminds you not to hate society or humans despite its faults, despite how it kills innocence and those who cause no harm. It teaches you to not do so, with its most famous line,

 It took me a long time to read To Kill A Mockingbird, I tried years ago and gave up only because of a dislike of the font in my copy of it. I got over that now, or I forced myself to, and I'm glad I did. I found the book utterly charming. Painted from a child's perspective it puts a lot of focus on life from a 'simpler' world that one recognizes well (eavesdropping and sibling fights included)while the dramatic race-plot is for a long time nothing but a dark shadow that doesn't take center stage until the end. 
 The picture that Lee paints is not only beautiful and amusing but in the end also thought provoking. I think what you can get out of TKAM is little bit dependent on what you're searching for and how you view Scout and the time she lives in. All in all I think it's a book well worth reading but it almost feels as though it should be mandatory to partake in a book discussion about it when one does.

 The second is how again and again Atticus reminds Scout that these people (the people he disagrees with, the people in different social standings) are ""our friends."" 
 It was a bit of a shock to the senses as I've become quick to outrage at other people's opinions and find myself thinking very unkindly (or just unfriending) people with whom I disagree on any sort of social network.

The narrator, Jean Louise (Scout) Finch is a bright, precocious child who embraces life with open arms and innocently abandons the typical stereotype of a ""proper Southern young lady"". Maycomb, Alabama is typically framed as a small town in the Deep South in the 1930s fraught with all of the typical baggage and hypocrisy that comes with that setting. Published in 1960, this novel had to help in some manner to awaken a beginning sense of change, however small, from long held customs and practices, from assumptions and deeply ingrained prejudices. Yes, racism continues and is alive decades later in many forms and likely always will be, but the clearly cut boundaries of the pre-60s South which could in no way be crossed and the widely held assumptions of inequality throughout the nation founded on equality were clearly addressed head-on in this book. All who have loved it for 55 years and have read and reread and shared it with their children and grandchildren are better for having come to know Atticus Finch, an all time favorite character for me. We can only wish that there were more men and women with the convictions and ""quiet heroism"" of an Atticus Finch in our communities.","Thu Sep 18 14:28:00 -0700 2008","Mon Aug 03 20:37:53 -0700 2015","Mon Aug 03 00:00:00 -0700 2015","Sat Aug 01 00:00:00 -0700 2015",1,0

 I'm pretty sure in a previous blog I said that school has destroyed a million books for me, one of the key ones being To Kill A Mockingbird. In school, they'd analyse every little detail, force you to power read through books just to meticulously examine every turn of phrase of motif and ARRRGH. School ruined so many books for me, and I suppose it's time I read them off my own back, and in the case of this I'm really glad I did. 
 This is one of my best friend's favourite books. It's such a good book (not that anyone needing telling) and it reminds me why I disliked school's approach to English. It's another reason I didn't take the subject at University. I couldn't handle more books being destroyed in this way. I liked being able to read this book without a teacher moaning that I wasn't reading fast enough, or being told to explain some minute turn of phrase or imagery. Ironically, I read it all in less than a day. I'm pretty sure my English teacher would have been overjoyed if I took to it so well back in school. So the lesson today is: I should re-read any books school destroyed because chances are they're actually great.","Wed Jan 02 04:19:53 -0800 2013","Fri Jan 04 15:01:17 -0800 2013","Thu Sep 06 00:00:00 -0700 2012","",0,0

 But it is no longer my dirty secret because I've read it now. 
 So what to say about the book? 
 There is a reason that despite its Mockingbird is still popular today. Part of it has to do with Scout and Jem. The two children are children. They are not stupid, but they are not super duper smarty pants either. They don't understand everything, and this is particularly true of Scout who tells the reader things that the reader grasps quicker than she does. Lee doesn't use them as bludgeon you to death avatars. 
 And because she doesn't do that the book works brilliantly. And Scout, well, Scout is the right kind of girl. 
 But it isn't about that, at least not entirely, and it's not entirely about race (and quite, frankly whoever thinks this book is racist needs to be smacked until Sunday) because the book is about perceptions and truth.

 I identified hard with Scout. I cried at the end without knowing why I was crying--I was too ignorant to sense Scout's end of innocence. But the book stayed with me, of course, as the good ones do. 
 In later years I read it with both my kids, and it was interesting to read it as an adult, as well as see the story through a girl's eyes then a boy's. The story took on so many layers; we talked a lot about it, about the early sixties and the civil unrest, what it was like when kids from inner city L.A. were bussed to the overcrowded schools.

 5***** and a 
 Is this the quintessential American Novel? Will it stand the test of time as Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has done? Time will tell. 
 I do know this, however. This is a singularly powerful novel that had a great impact on me when I first read it at age 13 (shortly after it was first published), and has never failed to move and inspire me as I've re-read it over the years (at least 20 times by now). It has touched generations of readers in the 50-something years since it was first released, and remains high on many ""must be read"" lists. 
 There are many reasons for this. It's a well-paced novel, a fast read with elements of suspense, family drama, humor and moral lessons. Scout is a wonderful narrator, both as a child and as an adult looking back on her childhood; and the fact that Lee was able to seamlessly move between these two viewpoints is a testament to her skill as a writer. 
 Many people feel this is a book about racism. I don't think that is the core theme of the book, though it is the central plot device Lee uses. I think the major theme of the novel is personal integrity and courage - doing what you know is right when all about you seemingly disagree and even when it may be dangerous to do so, being true to your own moral compass, and instilling those values in your children by example not just words. 
 In this respect Atticus Finch shines as the protagonist of this work. He is a man of strong moral fiber, a man who is ""the same in his house as he is on the public street,"" a man ""who was born to do our unpleasant jobs for us."" He embodies the lessons he tries to impart to his children: that courage is not a man with a gun in his hands but rather, ""It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what."" 
 The novel aims a spotlight on a particular time and place in America's history. Lee writes with clarity and colors this world for the reader with descriptions that put us squarely in Maycomb, Alabama circa 1935: Somehow it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summer's day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men's stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o'clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum."" 
 The minor characters, especially the women, are as richly drawn as the major players. I was struck by what a wide range of personalities, strengths, weaknesses and ethics Lee was able to express using characters such as Calpurnia, Aunt Alexandra, Helen Robinson, Mrs Merriweather, Lula, Miss Maudie, Mrs Dubose, Miss Caroline and Mayella Ewell. Some of them appear for only a page or two, but they come alive on the page and remain in the reader's memories. 
 The audio book is performed by Academy-Award-winning actress Sissy Spacek. She does an admirable job, though her accent is wrong. She is a Texan, and the Southern Alabama accent is softer than her twang. Still, by the second disc I had stopped noticing this, and allowed myself to be carried into the story by her expert reading.

Unlike many teenagers, this was not a required text for my English Literature class at school. You know what? I feel mighty ripped off. The English class read this book, but apparently the Literature class (which I was only in because it 'balanced' my ratio of Humanities to Science) was too cool for this book. (We read Patrick White, which does not compare and completely turned me off his works). 
 Oh how wrong. This is a fantastic, captivating, interesting and dramatic piece of LITERATURE. Take that high school! 
 The premise is simple - Scout (real name Jean Louise) and Jem (Jeremy) are the children of one of the most underrated heroes of literature, Atticus Finch. Atticus is a local lawyer in Maycomb, called on to represent a black man charged with raping a white woman. The book captures the essence of 1930s Alabama in a way that so few books do - right down to manners, social conventions and racism. The book simmers with undertones - how the different races act towards each other, how the different classes act, how 'different' people are treated (such as Boo Radley, who appears to have a mental illness) and how it doesn't make sense to children such as Scout and Jem. 
 Scout is the first person narrator. It is told with her looking back at the events that unfolded starting with the summer before she started school and culminating several years later. With the wisdom of age, Scout adopts a more mature tone and thought process than for example, Jack from Room. But it also allows us to see the racism and prejudice going on through her innocent eyes. 
 Scout is a tomboy, who prefers overalls to dresses and solves fights with fisticuffs. Despite her getting in a lot of trouble for her ways, it is her strength of character and willingness to fight - not just in the schoolyard, but against adult bullies - that makes her likeable and effective. Atticus is a true hero in his own way - he quietly fights for what is right (his courtroom scenes are subtle, yet powerful) and lets his children have just enough freedom for them to develop as individuals. 
 What makes this book work? A lot of things - the characters are endearing and/or memorable, even the minor ones (Miss Maudie, who the children turn to for advice and cookies, is delightful in her straight-talking ways), the slow build of tension that reaches a crescendo with the court case and that even though dramatic events unfold, there's a lot of real life in there. Not everything goes to plan, not everything happens the way it should 
 This is a book you can read over and over, taking pleasure in different things each time. Don't write it off as something to study, this book should be celebrated for the masterpiece it is.

 I am not sure what made me like this book. I think it was the fact that here was a man accused of a crime that he did not do. No matter how the law says ""innocent until proven guilty"". he was still guilty because of the color of his skin. this was a time still of segregation and people of color were still a long ways from gaining any rights of an American citizen.

 A lot as been said about the importance of this book for American society and its symbolism, so for the obvious reasons I'm not going to dwell about that. It's an amazing book one that everyone should read and one that I should have read a long time ago. 
 I made the mistake of watching the 1962 movie adaptation before I finished the book so I was pretty much spoiled about the ending. I found the book and movie to be very different. The movie omits a lot of aspects of the book, lots of little stories and sub-plots, and focuses more on Atticus Finch; portrayed by the amazing actor Gregory Peck, who ended winning an Oscar for it, and less on the children. 
 I also decided I wanted to know more about the book and especially about the reclusive author after finding out this was her only novel apart from a few short essays.

 --- 
 It will be news to basically no one that To Kill a Mockingbird is an amazing novel. I'm just learning that now, though, as this wasn't offered as part of my high school curriculum, and that's a shame. It would be a great book to read in your early teens. Not only would it have led to some interesting discussion around race issues, but Atticus Finch would be such a great role model to have in one's life growing up, even if just in fiction. 
 Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing. 
 This is the story of six-year-old Jean Louise Finch who prefers to go by the name of Scout. She lives in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama with her brother Jem and widowed father Atticus. The first half of the book is composed of scenes from her childhood as she and her brother attend school, puzzle over their reclusive neighbour Boo Radley, and enjoy the long summers. It really felt like a Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn story at parts, in a great way - pure innocent childhood adventures. 
 The second half of the book has more of a central plot in which Atticus Finch, a lawyer by trade, has been tasked with defending a local black man accused of molesting a white girl. At the time, a black man accused of such a thing was essentially guilty before the trial had even begun, and to defend him with any sort of earnestness was to subject yourself to a lot of anger from the community. Atticus Finch believes the man to be innocent, however, and he's truthful and kind to the core, so he fights what most people consider a futile fight. Over the course of the trial, and during its aftermath, the seemingly inconsequential events from the first half of the book all tie together nicely as the children start to grow up. 
 As you grow older, you'll see white men cheat black men every day of your life, but let me tell you something and don't you forget it--whenever a white man does that to a black man, no matter who he is, how rich he is, or how fine a family he comes from, that white man is trash. 
 I really loved everything about this and every character in it. The narrator Scout is fantastic, but everyone else in the book is so vivid on the page as well. Atticus Finch is one of my new favourite fictional characters, I think. In a way he almost comes across as somewhat one-dimensional. He's established as the wise and calm father from the beginning and stays that way throughout the novel, but I thought it was really interesting how the children's views of him changed. His depth and character arc comes out through the eyes of Scout and Jem. They see him at the beginning of the novel as a completely different person than they do at the end. I love how they come to realize how principled a man he is as the novel progresses, how some of his decisions they had assumed were made from fear were actually made with patience and humility, and how you could see his attitude quietly affect them in ways that would change the adults they eventually become. 
 I'm not sure I'll read Go Set a Watchman. Everything seems off about the publication of that, and I think I'd rather not overshadow this story with an apparently mediocre prequel. Obviously I've just read To Kill a Mockingbird for the first time, so I don't have any sacred nostalgia tied to it, but even so I'm happy with it as it is. I have no idea if Harper Lee is being taken advantage of by her publisher, but I hate the idea of an author's work being published without their permission, especially if it may in any way tarnish his or her existing work. 
 Harper Lee is going to publish a sequel after 55 years...

 This is one of those novels that I probably wouldn't have gotten around to reading if I hadn't started this blog. More and more of what I read these days fall under that same category, and it's worth acknowledging. Sometimes it seems silly to write about every book I read and take part in challenges to read more classics, but there's no doubting that it's changed my reading for the better.","Thu Aug 20 13:57:49 -0700 2015","Sun Nov 27 12:20:20 -0800 2016","Wed Sep 16 00:00:00 -0700 2015","Thu Aug 20 00:00:00 -0700 2015",1,0

 Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I would like to start by saying how sorry I am to be here today. I considered the deceased a friend. I tried to convince him to act fairly and rationally, in accordance with the best principles of the Danish Constitution. It was easy to understand why he was upset, but, in all honesty, I could not accept that his evidence amounted to proof. The ""ghost"" he claimed he saw on two occasions - well, we have just heard Mr. Horatio's testimony, and I freely admit that, as he says, there are more things in Heaven and Earth than are dreamed of in his philosophy. All the same, no court would have considered it admissible. The incident of the play was, I agree, far more compelling. Several witnesses - Miss Poloniusdatter was very eloquent - have provided us with their accounts. They coincide well with the one Mr. Hamlet gave me. I went absolutely as far as I could to help him. I told him I thought it warranted further investigation, and I promised in writing - I will show you the letter in a moment - that I would take steps to appoint a Special Prosecutor, as specified in Article 312, paragraphs iv) and v). I honestly don't think many lawyers would have done that. I was taking a serious professional risk, but I believed it was the right thing to do. I'm sorry? Did you say timeframe? I was just coming to that. I said I would progress the case as fast as I could. I thought I would be able to get the Special Prosecutor appointed within as little as eight months, and if things went well we would have convened a Grand Jury by April 1602. We could have been looking at a trial by early 1603. Yes, that is correct, I do remember him talking about the law's delay. He's not the first person I've heard say that. And I'm sorry, I didn't know what a fardel was. I still don't. Maybe someone could tell me? 
 Your honor, I have tried to answer all your questions to the best of my ability. If I had been able to stop Mr. Hamlet from killing himself, I would have done so. Please don't clap. I don't deserve your applause. I wish I could have done better. What do you mean, I've won? This isn't a contest. No one has won here, least of all me.","Mon Oct 10 14:34:15 -0700 2011","Fri Jan 10 02:55:42 -0800 2014","","",19,9

 It was beautiful, it made me think, it gave me insight of how things were in America at that time. I'm not American, but I'm aware of racism(in America and outside of it, because let's face it, it's an international issue), I think it's important to write this sort of books and read them too. Because they make us more aware of things that happen daily, of things that we're sometimes ignorant of because we're not a part of them. Harper Lee wrote about these issues and many more, her book is a lesson and I loved to be taught through every page about something new.

""How could this book possibly be any good if I'm being forced to read it?"" I applied those same feelings to this book at that time, and begrudgingly slogged my way through it. (I did finish it, however, unlike almost every other book our teachers handed us, such as Grapes of Wrath and My Antonia.) 
 When I decided to read the book again this year, I initially couldn't remember much about it, except for a few of the major plot points. I knew the narrator was a young Southern girl named Scout whose father, Atticus, was defending a black man in a controversial case and that they had a reclusive neighbor called Boo Radley, but that was about it. As I starting making progress, however, the narratives were instantly familiar, and yet so much more eloquent and poignant than I remembered. The characterization is strong, and Scout's observations are just as important today as they were when the novel was released. I really don't know what else to say that hasn't been said a thousand times before, but I will tell you that I enjoyed it a lot this second time.

 Not only was To Kill a Mockingbird Harper Lee's only novel, at one point she nearly destroyed it.

 Warning: some spoilers might be ahead! 
 To Kill A Mockingbird is not only a book about ""a simple love story,"" as the author regarded, but a brilliant piece that touches on many aspects of life. It includes messages such as the loss of innocence, perspective, courage, the coexistence of good and evil, prejudice and the different social classes that's apparent throughout human actuality. The transition from innocence to a more mature view of the world is carried out by both Scout, the narrator, and her brother Jem. 
 Jem gets his first real taste of racism while watching and hearing Judge Taylor asking Tom questions; it makes him rethink about the traits that humans have. Scout is able to really understand what Atticus means when he tells her to put herself in the shoes of others; she manage to do so when she sees the world through Arthur's point of view. 
 The purpose of the book isn't for the killing of mockingbirds. It's a symbolism that relates to generally all of the themes shown in this book. ""Shoot all the bluejays you want...but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."" Tom Robinson and Arthur Radley are both examples of mockingbirds. They don't do anything to others, and yet they get hurt and polluted by society and reality. 
 Harper Lee used Atticus as the main voice for the recognition of virtues which plays a big part to identifying the messages that she incorporated into the novel.

 This is considered a classic but it is soo very different from the other classics that I have read. I don't know why, but always because of the title of this book I thought this will be a difficult book to read and kept on pushing off reading this. How I repent not reading this earlier!! 
 Firstly I had no idea that this whole book is from a child's perspective. The book's basic premise does deal with a very serious topic . But the way it has been written somehow makes it easier to read (I did not have the heavy feeling that is associated with most of the classics). 
 The start of the book reminded me of all the children's book I have ever read- the world is innocent all around and life is all about fun and games. But as the story moves forward and the main protagonist (Scout) becomes aware of all the evil's that surround her, we too experience this awakening with her. I really think this was a very unique way of making the reader realize how the innocence of this child is shattered and there is a stage of awareness of the rights and wrong (We all have been through that). 
 The author has also beautifully iterated to the reader that it is easier for the children to differentiate between right and wrong than adults who are prejudiced by their own narrow view of how the world should be. 
 If you haven't already read this, I highly recommend reading this book. I am very interested in seeing the screen adaptation of this story.","Thu Apr 14 02:32:25 -0700 2016","Fri Aug 18 10:29:00 -0700 2017","Fri Jul 07 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Fri Jun 30 00:00:00 -0700 2017",33,12

 Actually, this one was recommended (rather non-voluntarily) to me by a creep on the internet who took offense at me wanting to spend a year reading books written by women. Unfortunately, I didn't take note of his user name and don't know how to get in touch with him again to thank him... As malicious as his comment might have been, this is indeed a very good book. It was further recommended by Michelle, so he doesn't get all the points for this. 
 English is not my first language, so I didn't read this in school. My required reading was very different. I'm not absolutely sure I would have enjoyed it if I had read it as a child, but I tend to believe so. The prose is delicious, the characters are captivating, the story is adventurous. 
 I'm sure, this being such a famous and important book, that there are many reviews for it, and they must have discussed its elements quite thoroughly. That being the case, I'll just save my words and simply say that I've enjoyed it and very much recommend it.

I started reading To Kill a Mockingbird in my english class during my high school years. This great tale started off very interesting from the characters personalities and the time & setting. I have to admit that it was an excellent source of literary knowledge of older times. 
 Here is the story plot is about a young girl named Scout, her older brother Jem, and their loving father Atticus, living in a small town in Alabama during the 1930s. At the beginning of the book it's mostly centered about Scout, Jem, and Dill,(Jem and Scouts summer friend), trying to get the mysterious Boo Radly to come out of his house. As well as some of their adventures together from school, play relatives/neighbors life happenings. Now during the later portion the novel it's more about their father Atticus defending an innocent blackman on trial, for a crime he didn't commit, and how it affects his family and everyone in their small southern town. That's where the story really spins for you. The emotional rollor coaster that the story takes you to the highs & low of the courts and people outcome. It is an all together beautiul bittersweet coming of age tale of growing up, innocences, and acceptence of life's circumstances. 
 I rate this novel with 10 stars & 2 thumbs up. The movie was wonderful too. Even though it was not exactly like the book. They had to make the film shorter. But Gregory Peck delivers a marvalous performance as Atticus Finch and the children too. =)~","Thu Jul 01 19:49:24 -0700 2010","Sat Jul 03 20:54:27 -0700 2010","","",0,0

In some respects, I was like Scout when she complains to Atticus that her teacher isn't letting her read and write at home. I was already reading more interesting things than what any teacher forced me to read in class, and that year my teacher's complete lack of interest in TKAM made me disconnect even more. That too often classes in English classes in school; you tune out and hate the book forever. I thought TKAM was an okay book back then, but I had a tainted memory of it in my head and didn't understand why everyone loved it. Specifically, why they loved Atticus Finch. 
 I can't count how many times I've seen Atticus lauded as a hero, for reasons I didn't understand until yesterday, when I started reading TKAM again. And then it was like a mockingbird crashed directly into my face. 
 Justice has a funny way of working itself into tales of heroism and bravery, into those stories where everyone gets what they deserve and it ends on a happy note. And there really isn't a more stereotypical place for it than within a courtroom, where Atticus Finch feels it's his duty to defend one of the least-respected members of society in the sluggish little town of Maycomb, Alabama. It's a lot like Twelve Angry Men, when you believe Henry Fonda is crusading for the true and just cause of exonerating a kid who doesn't deserve the treatment he's getting. 
 But the thing that's great about TKAM is how skillfully Harper Lee builds up a standard story arc and then demolishes it. The last third of the book -- although I did remember bits and pieces from my first read-through -- was shocking to me, but in an angry, inspirational way. I had a sickening feeling the racial and class disparity in Maycomb wouldn't be magically saved in the trial, no matter the verdict, and the final climactic scene on Halloween night left me feeling a mix of melancholy and awe. 
 Harper Lee writes a superb story, one that practically compelled me to read the book in two big chunks; I was never bored. Scout (and Jem, too) is a fun narrator, who combines the sense of childhood ignorance the entire town depends on with the yearning for justice that her father instills in her. And that makes the book a more interesting read because Scout is not actively involved in everything that goes on; rather, she's an unwitting bystander to some of the town's biggest upheavals. She's a precocious girl, sure, but Lee wrote it purposefully so she wouldn't full comprehend all she was seeing or hearing. The reader still relies on Atticus to explain everything to us, except in the places where the ""grown-up"" talk goes above Scout's head. 
 I don't often wonder about characters beyond the end of a novel. But I fear the events of the novel, had they actually happened exactly the way Scout interprets them, would have turned her off of hope for any kind of tolerance and anti-discrimination in her hometown. She is asked in the book what she wants to be when she grows up -- a lawyer, like her father, or something else? -- but she replies that she's never really thought about it. Lee's novel makes you want to believe Scout and Jem have been changed for the better, but Atticus' remark that things are just the way they are and won't always chance despite a great character's best intentions. 
 That's Atticus in a nutshell. The events of one fateful summer hung on him heavily, on the entire family, and impacted them for a period of a couple of years. He taught his own children, and multiple generations of eager readers, the true lessons of kindness, tolerance and decency, even in the face of something over which you have no power. Karma doesn't always come back around to fight with you instead of against you, but as Atticus taught, sometimes you just have to do something because otherwise you couldn't go around living with yourself.","Sun Mar 17 19:34:45 -0700 2013","Sat May 10 11:48:18 -0700 2014","Sat May 10 11:48:18 -0700 2014","Fri May 09 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0

To Kill a Mockingbird is the story of a coming-of-age girl that witnesses the wrongful treatment of a Negro accused of rape in the 1930s' South. The first part of the book draws in detail the white society as seen by Louise (Scout), the motherless girl under ten of Lawyer Atticus Finch. In this part, Harper Lee gives full account of her wonderful writing skill, including memorable formulations such as ""People in their right minds never take pride in their talents"", ""With him, life was routine, without him, life was unbearable"", and ""She was never bored, and given the slightest chance she would exercise her royal prerogative: she would arrange, advise, caution, and warn."" In the second part we get in touch with the heart-breaking (and still socially-relevant) story of Tom Robinson, the Negro accused to have raped a girl. When Atticus Finch becomes his defender-in-court, Scout (and we through her eyes) becomes the at first amazed and at last ashamed witness to the social divide between Whites and Negroes. The story evolves rapidly to a tormenting and still actual conclusion. A must-read for everyone, and especially for the Western society.","Wed Dec 31 01:50:01 -0800 2008","Wed Nov 04 06:54:05 -0800 2009","Thu Oct 29 00:00:00 -0700 2009","",1,0

 Finally, after 23 years, I read this classic and wow, people weren't kidding: this book is something special. This novel isn't only a great children's book, but also a wonderful coming-of-age story of Jem and Scout, and a serious (adult) book about racism, honour, and different forms of courage. 
 This books reads like a play: you first start by setting the scene (Maycomb, a small Southern town in Alabama) and by growing familiar with the characters: the siblings Scout and Jem and their father Atticus. This slow start doesn't appeal to everyone, but due to Harper Lee's story telling I was never bored. The narrator of this story is young tomboy Jean Louise (Scout), and her observations of Maycomb and people's behavior are simple, honest, and visually very rich. I had no problem picturing Scout, Jem and Dill's childish efforts to draw Boo Radley out of his house, or Calpurnia taking the kids to a colored church. 
 But when, after 128 pages, the court case begins and the plot really becomes intriguing, you immediately feel a rise in tension and excitement. Here Jem and Atticus become the main characters instead of Scout because they are more aware of the risks and importance of the case, although Scout's moment with the mob was heartwrenchingly beautiful in it's innocence. 
 The last part of the book was less tense but never dull: it was important to show the aftermath and the effects of the case on different class - and races - of people to convey the impact of Atticus' actions. Because back in 1935 and even now, in our current political situation, standing up for what's right while the majority is against you, is an incredible brave and difficult thing to do. 
 ""Courage is not a man with a gun in his hand. It's knowing you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do."" 
 One thing especially about this story that stood out to me, are the interesting gender roles in this book. We have Atticus who isn't only presented as an amazing father but also as a great male character, because he's patient, courteous, clever...but not traditionally masculine. In contrast with Bob Ewell, the main antagonist, Atticus isn't physically strong, doesn't use strong language, and hates violence (example: he keeps his shooting skills a secret from his children). 
 His sister, aunt Alexandra, is a very traditional female figure who wants Scout to behave more 'lady like', and because Scout doesn't like her (at first), we as readers dislike her too. Acting as her opposites are Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, who neither show traditional feminine characteristics like politeness and charm, but both are presented as good and right. 
 And what do the other (minor) characters teach us? Like Mrs. Dubose, that nasty old lady, who is described by Atticus as 'the bravest person he ever knew'? And what about Mayella Ewell? Lee leaves her role in the open, letting us decide if she's either an antagonist or a victim. 
 ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is a well-loved book for many good reasons, but I was very surprised by its diverse male and female characters, who make this story even richer that it already is. 
 So this was an absolute beautiful read, told by two precious children and an inspiring father, who teaches us about justice, prejudice, and empathy. A book I'll definitely read to my children in the future, and a novel I can recommend to anyone.","Wed Jan 04 02:49:36 -0800 2017","Tue Apr 11 08:40:59 -0700 2017","Thu Jan 19 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 -0800 2017",57,5

 Atticus Finch is the ultimate hero: detached yet loving, smart yet humble. The portrayal of southern Alabama in the 30s (which I believe to be as much of a character in the novel as Atticus is) is fabulous. Scout, who sometimes leads the narration from the perspective of a 7 year old girl an sometimes a grown woman reflecting on her youth, is instantly lovable. And despite some of the language the young scout uses seeming a little bit too adult for her, she's utterly believable.

The other, much smaller, camp is much more negative, going so far as to call it painful and not worth reading at all. I find myself very much in the middle of these groups (which I'm sure will endear me to nobody). 
 To Kill a Mockingbird is a story told through the eyes of Scout, a young girl growing up in the South. She, her brother, Jem, and their friend, Dill, hang out and try to draw out the neighborhood recluse, Boo Radley. Scout's father, Atticus, is a lawyer, and he happens to take on a very controversial case. A young Black man is accused of raping a young White girl, and Atticus is tasked with defending the man. The town is mostly very much against Atticus in this case - the very idea of taking a Black person's word over a White person's is abhorrent to them. Scout tries to make sense of the world and her community in the face of injustice and racism throughout the book, which culminates in a harrowing series of events that leave Scout and Jem in peril. 
 Overall, To Kill a Mockingbird is enjoyable. It moves along at a solid pace, and it keeps your attention with amusing side stories. It's a well-told story. But I felt that, in many ways, it was a bit clumsy. In particular, I find the way the theme is presented to be pretty ham fisted. It's just so in-your-face about the injustice in the South before the Civil Rights era, without any trace of subtlety. It's so blatant that I don't think it's very effective at changing anyone's mind or showing someone anything new. Very few people are honest with themselves when it comes to prejudice. It's just so difficult to judge ourselves objectively and harshly, particularly when it comes to race. I think that when a lot of people read this book, they feel self-righteous and angry, but they don't feel anything that would cause them to change or view to the world differently. This is what I expect of great books with worthy themes, and To Kill a Mockingbird does not live up to that. 
 So I don't really understand the adoration for it - it's ok, but it's really not that great. I also don't really understand the hate - it's not great, but it's really not that bad. I certainly don't think it's a must-read, but I think a lot of people would enjoy reading To Kill a Mockingbird as a piece of very slightly socially conscious fluff.","Sat Apr 06 20:34:33 -0700 2013","Mon Nov 24 14:29:43 -0800 2014","Mon Nov 24 14:29:43 -0800 2014","Tue Nov 18 00:00:00 -0800 2014",0,0

I always feel -- often rightfully so -- that I'm being horribly judged every time I admit that. I once had somebody say to me, ""No offense, but... do you maybe think you just didn't get the entire meaning of the book?"" 
 Haha, that's cute. To answer your question, no, I don't think I missed the meaning. How could I miss it when Harper Lee all but comes out and beats you to death with it? There's the good people, there's the bad people, and the children can easily see how every single person in their lives fits into one of these boxes because they have the sweetness and innocence of childhood, blah blah blah. 
 Other people feel differently about this, but my personal feeling is that if a book is going to be overtly didactic it should at least have a message that's unique and thought-provoking. If it doesn't, then it's like listening to the kind of story that you would tell a kindergarten class where we all learn that it's important to SHARE :o. That's why I don't care for this book. (It's also why Mitch Albom is among my all-time least favourite authors, but that's an issue for another review...) 
 Another problem I have with this book is that it seems to several short stories weakly bundled together, rather than a whole cohesive story. Apparently that was one of the criticisms the publishers had of the rough draft, which is why Harper Lee added the whole Boo Riley thread -- to add some sort of continuity to the story. 
 I've sometimes felt that I should really try to like this book more because other people seem to love it so much. Ultimately, though, I've decided that I don't care. To me, this book is a bunch of (not particularly interesting) episodes haphazardly strung together, with a few hackneyed, pseudo-philosophical platitudes thrown in here and there for good measure.","Wed Jul 02 08:35:31 -0700 2014","Sat Aug 13 08:58:53 -0700 2016","Tue Nov 01 00:00:00 -0800 2005","",0,0

If you read them, you were well-read and intelligent, if you didn't read you were busy. If you read something else, you were shallow and delusional. 
 I considered this problem and came up with a reasonable solution. I went around and read all of these classics in a year or so. Some of them I enjoyed, some of them I didn't. More importantly though they served their purpose, I'd read any mandatory reading we had till the end of high school and anytime someone heard I liked books and asked me if I had read Jane Austin or Jane Eyre, or another kind of Jane, I could say yes and leave it at that. 
 It was a good plan and it served me well, It left me free to read anything I wanted until I came to my character enough to realise I didn't care what people thought about what I read. That year of studying classics still serves me well when I'm having a literally argument, put forward a great example from a fantasy and face either blank looks or snickers, then I can go around and say something from a classic, something they'd either feel obliged to accept or be too ashamed to confess they haven't read. 
 However I'd never read To kill a mockingbird until this day. The reason is simple, it's not considered a classic in my country, it's not even famous. It wasn't until I was deep into my English reading that I first heard its name. I got the book out of a different ( and yet similar ) kind of attitude to my classic reading in third grade, because I felt an obligation to read it, this time to myself as a reader. Yet it sat in my shelves for ages and I never picked it up, with so many books I was extremely exited to read coming out every day it was hard to make time to read something out of obligation. 
 So despite being left unread, when I was preparing to move to another country it wasn't one of the (Sadly small) number of books I could bring with me. 
 Imagine how I felt when I got here, signed up for a writing class and realised this was the mandatory reading! I wasn't sure if I should laugh or bang my head against the walls. 
 It was like this that after years I finally read To Kill a Mockingbird. 
 Maybe you're wondering why I'm wasting your time telling this long fetched story that has nothing to do with reviewing the book. 
 It's because I don't plan on reviewing it. I liked the book well enough. I liked the characters a whole lot, the parts about women's part in the society that irked me at times weren't anywhere as bad as Little Women, I liked what it was saying, I tried to learn from the crisp clear writing and more than anything I enjoyed how alive the narrative was. 
 But I don't want to review it because no one cares. If I didn't like it and I could come up with a hundred good reasons no one would care either. This is a classic and it has its set place and no review of it really matters. 
 So this isn't a review of the book, it's a review of classic worshipping frame of my mind. I don't know what it's liked in other countries. But I do know in mine it's the biggest reason people don't read. I'm sure there are some people who can start reading with reading war and peace and only read books that teaches them something, but for every one of them there has been 30 others who's learned forever to look at reading as boring because their true genre was fantasy or adventure and they'd been snobbed into classics. However even worse than this are the people who have learned to automatically assume any books their teachers ask them to read is boring and never even give it a chance. 
 So I guess this is what I'm saying, about To Kill a Mocking bird or any other book of its kind. You don't have to read them to be intelligent or well-read. You don't have to read them to be a bookworm. In fact, there is no single reason for you to read them other than wanting to, because that's the only way you'll really enjoy them anyway.","Thu Jul 07 17:38:29 -0700 2016","Sun Jul 10 05:34:30 -0700 2016","Sun Jul 10 09:26:25 -0700 2016","Thu Jul 07 00:00:00 -0700 2016",2,0

 Yet, I wasn't totally satisfied.

I'm curious, I'll obtain the new novel soon). Given that context, the novel was a great achievement. It reminds me somewhat of uncle Tom's cabin, though a bit better.

 Favourite character: Atticus. He's just so intelligent and wise, and the scene where he took down the dog with one shot was just too cool. That was probably not the point of the story, but oh, well. I thought it was seriously awesome that he had a hidden ninja history. 
 Scout was a funny protagonist. I like the way she sees a lot of things and the way she recounts a story. She's a tough little cookie, and I would start laughing every time she spoke about beating other boys up. I like that she didn't listen to her aunt, who told her to wear dresses. 
 Also: ham costume. That cracked me up. 
 I really liked the ending and the circular plot. (view spoiler)[As soon as I read that Scout heard the sound of something of Jem's breaking, I was like, IT'S HIS ARM. THIS IS FROM THE START OF THE BOOK. It was really good. 
 Other good things include the courtroom scene; it was really intense! I loved how Atticus acted and how smart he was. Whenever Mayella messed up or Atticus made a good point, I would be like, OHHHHH YES. YOU SHOW 'EM WHO'S BOSS. (hide spoiler)]

 To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee was a captivating and beautiful book. Although I had to read this for school, I sure enjoyed it. Harper Lee had covered many themes that were weaved into the plot, making it a intersting and delightful read. I really enjoyed the deep writing, plot, and characters. They all contributed in a way to making the book and its messages vivid. A historical fiction classic, this book is one of my favorites.

 -- Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird 
 I loved the characters- it's as simple as that. They all are different but deeply developed and loveable. From spunky Scout to pensive Jem and even-handed Atticus. I just adored them all from their greatest to not so heroic moments. Each of them taught me something and I feel they are as real as can be- I mean how can you not? I really loved all their adventures in finding themselves and understanding the world. 
 Back then in their time, I can only imagine the difficulties of human ignorance, but some people today aren't far off. Modern times and past times don't really have a difference when it comes down to human moral nature. But despite it all, the characters stayed strong and true to the end. Atticus was a favorite, he was such a caring and gentle parent, but also an understanding and logic adult. His unique way of raising Scout and Jem was what made the family one of a kind with their values and considerate perception. 
 I also had to cherish Dill, Mrs. Maudie, Aunt Alexandra, Judge Taylor, Cal, Mr. Tate and of course Mr. Arthur Radley. Or Boo Radley as I like to say with the kids. But in all, I have to say I despised Bob Ewell and his freakin' family along with the rest of the hypocrite town of Maycomb. Like at times, I just wanted to imagine actually spitting and kicking those people. Good Lord, I might just do that with the next racist person I see. People really disgust me at times, they are just wholly revolting. When will the human race stop spliting itself up and grow up?! Somethings in this world will probably never change yet, not for a long while I suppose. 
 ""Sometimes the Bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whisky bottle in the hand of (another)... There are just some kind of men who - who're so busy worrying about the next world they've never learned to live in this one, and you can look down the street and see the results."" 
 -- Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird 
 ""It was times like these when I thought my father, who hated guns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who ever lived."" 
 -- Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird 
 ""As you grow older, you'll see white men cheat black men every day of your life, but let me tell you something and don't you forget it - whenever a white man does that to a black man, no matter who he is, how rich he is, or how fine a family he comes from, he is trash."" 
 -- Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird 
 In conclusion, To Kill a Mockingbird was a great classic. I was throughly delighted and have learned much from this book. I adored the characters and I just loved how the story unwrapped. It was like growing up with Scout and Jem over the years, witnessing the understanding and innocence. This book is another written proof of what human ignorance and its consequences and effects on the world looks like. Harper Lee has an amazing way of writing through the eyes of a child along with the words of an adult mixed in. Her characters, plot and story were just sooo good. I really was glad that I finally got around to it (even though school had to really push me into it)- and I recommend this great read. Really touching and straight at its purpose.

 To kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee is a supreme classic. It""s an austere yet elegant book written from the POV of a little girl, Jean Louise Finch a.k.a. Scout. who narrates about the ridiculous attitude of adult men and women towards class and racism, prevalent in the 1930s world, as perceived by her childlike mind. 
 In the first part, the county's lawyer, Atticus Finch tells his children this- 
 ""Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."" 
 At first I was flummoxed by what exactly Atticus had meant. But as the story progressed, the mist cleared off as easily as it came. The title as well as the quote is literally insignificant, but does bear considerable meaning to the very context of the book. Mockingbirds here probably imply innocence and ingenuousness. 
 ""Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nes in corncribs, they don't do one thing but ing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."" 
 The two kids, Jem and Scout through a span of a few years of their childhood take a plunge from a view that people were possibly good, and that they meant no evil, to bringing themselves to think that evil, injustice and hypocrisy are just as evident in every sphere of life. No, the book doesn't work on a pessimistic and negative vision entirely. It unfolds with unblemished dexterity to elucidate that most often people around us are a mix of both decent and vice. The perfect example here would be the Sheriff, Heck Tate, among many others. In the court case against Tom Robinson, he sided against Tom who was innocent, but when Mr. Bob Ewell tried to inflict harm onto Jem and Scout, and died in the process, despite Atticus's many objections, Mr. Tate stood unflinching on his stand that Mr. Ewell fell on his own knife and it wasn't the result of any juvenile slaying by Jem; here, he did what was lawful and right. 
 The best part of the book, for me, would be the court proceedings concerning Tom Robinson's case. Atticus's unprejudiced and vehement stance in defending Tom Robinson, a Negro who was falsely accused with the rape of a white girl shows his firm belief in moral values, devoid of any bigotry on account of colour, class or religion. To him, he was a man claiming his dignity from the tentacles of the selfish white lot. Everything in the case was in favour of Atticus. Everything but that jury, which was also a fragment of the cruel chauvinistic society, which placed Race above Innocence. The death of Tom Robinson is another example that justifies the title; he was a mockingbird slaughtered by the mean, hypocritical ways of the townsfolk. 
 Another interesting element in this book was Boo Radley. Harper Lee explores the voyage of the two kids, Jem and Scout in trying to unveil the mystery of the Radley place. Boo Radley's image gradually transforms from being a childhood rumour to a more grown-up outlook of being a lonely child of an atrocious father, who shut himself out from the world outside. Jem later even rationalizes this behaviour of his by saying that maybe he knew of the meanness in this world much more than they did. 
 ""Scout, I think I'm beginning to understand why Boo Radley's stayed shut up in the house all this time... Its because he wants to stay inside."" 
 Atticus Finch is a timeless character, totally down-to-earth, compassionate, humane. He is a remarkable father and he perseveres to pass on his moral values to his children. From being an impartial father when it comes to listening to the woes of his children, to being a person striving to seek goodness in every person of the world, he was the epitome of benevolence. 
 For instance, his take on Mrs. Dubose's character, no matter how cranky she had been to the kids- all attempted to implant that essence of goodness into his kids. 
 ""I wanted you to see something about her- I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you are licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do. Mrs. Dubose won, all ninety-eight pounds of her. According to her, she died beholden to nothing and nobody. She was the bravest person I ever knew."" 
 The language was splendid. Scout's POV was the best thing undoubtedly in this book, and it just kept me hanging till the end. I know the start might be dragging for some, but now that I'm done with the book, I think it was only because Lee attempted to get us accounted with the kids and with the very quintessence of childhood incorruptibility. 
 I don't know where I was all these years that I hadn't read this book, but now that I had, I'm so glad I did. Its a literary classic, and it ought to be celebrated.

And when Scout questioned Jem about the teacher's opinion of Hitler's injustice, I thought how smart she was to make the connection. If Jews in another country shouldn't be persecuted, why are ""niggers"" treated so badly at home? 
 The use of the ""n"" word certainly played a part in causing some to ban this book. Others may have had offense to the subject of the trial. Still this book is chosen for high school study in many schools. The lessons of prejudice and democracy need to be taught.

 The bout begins. 
 The opponents: Huckleberry Finn vs. Scout Finch. 
 Due to Huckleberry Finn's considerable advantage in size and experience, Scout is given the choice of venue and rules. She chooses the streets of Maycomb, Alabama and the rules of the Third Grade Playground. 
 The round starts with a surprise as Scout rushes headlong into Huck. No one expected such a direct assault from the tiny Scout. But inches before crashing into Huck she swerves, comes behind him, and gives him a monster wedgie. Huck's yelp is two octaves higher than usual. It takes him a few seconds to recover but he grabs Scout's head and proceeds to give her a few dozen noogies. As he looks around for an ink well to dip her hair into, Scout wiggles out of his hold and sticks her tongue out at him. 
 Huck continues to attack her but she easily evades every attempt. While Huck has the strength advantage, it is clear Scout is quicker. She has reverted to a ""Rope-A-Dope"" strategy, hoping to wear out Huck to the point of exhaustion. She begins to taunt him. 
 ""Hey Huck. You from the Show-Me State? You ain't shown me much!"" 
 Scout's ""Rope-a-Dope"" is clearly working. But in the midst of a clever ""Your daddy's so drunk"" routine, she is shoved from behind. Tom Sawyer has entered the street and pushed her down. Scout goes to the referee to demand a penalty for illegal interference. 
 The referee shows her section 98056.01(4) of the Third Grade Playground Rulebook that states interference by a player's homie is acceptable. 
 Scout is thrown off, expecting another attack by Tom. All of a sudden she puts her two fingers in her mouth and whistles. Out of a nearby house comes Boo Radley. He grabs Tom under the right arm, Huck under the left arm, and smashes their heads together. They go out cold. 
 The referee raises Scout's arm in victory: To Kill a Mockingbird by two knock-outs!","Thu Apr 30 21:18:24 -0700 2009","Sun Sep 22 22:33:23 -0700 2013","Sat May 16 00:00:00 -0700 2009","",17,3

 It's an absolute bore. I have read many but this tops the list of boring books. It just seems to drag on and on, and none of these reviews do any justice to it.

If you like books that seem to drag on, and never end, but in a positive light, this book is definitely not for you.

 It's not a matter of what we believe is right but rather a matter of how differently each one of us perceive the world and the people living in it.

I think the fact that it was written from a child's point of view makes it even more impressive. Since a child asks and says things we all wonder but tend to be (as adults) too afraid to ask. 
 A good example of this is how Scout mentions the hypocrisy of Miss Gates: 
 'Jem, how can you(Miss Gates) hate Hitler so bad but then turn around and be ugly about folks right at home - ?' 
 The person I felt the most sorry for at the end of this novel is Mrs.Robinson, all left alone with no husband, multiple children, no money and having nasty Mr. Ewell chase you; and then just to realize how many real life Mrs.Robinson's there must have been. 
 Overall a great piece of writing and a good introduction to American literature.","Wed Jul 22 03:58:48 -0700 2015","Wed Jul 29 09:22:29 -0700 2015","Wed Jul 29 13:05:25 -0700 2015","Wed Jul 22 00:00:00 -0700 2015",4,0

I thoroughly (though a little grudgingly at first) enjoyed this novel and concluded by the end that, in my opinion at least, it deserves its high place in literature. I anticipated something rather more depressing, but was pleasantly surprised; the racism was terrible, but Scout's narration lightened the atmosphere and Tom Robinson's case was not without positive ramifications. I also anticipated it being entirely about race-prejudice, but it was more about prejudice and people in general, and the ending delivered that theme with a punch. While it didn't make me cry, it did wrench my gut. 
 The loss of .5 stars was mostly for personal quibbles, especially the fact that I often found Atticus an irritatingly lenient and occasionally unobservant parent. It was also difficult to adjust to the children calling him by his first name. Still, they were respectful, and I did appreciate that.","Thu Jan 03 08:45:24 -0800 2013","Sun Jan 13 12:03:38 -0800 2013","Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 -0800 2013",2,1

Never satisfied about anything. Always wondering about that new book we bought. Brooding over the books read before. Unfulfilled corner in our room stuffed with books; both read and unread. It's like, we are always hoping for something better in the new book than the last. 
 I can easily say that that is not the case now. After a long time my perpetually hungry soul- that always feeds on the books I read- is downright sated now. I could go for days without having to wonder what to read next. I can bask in this story; a novelty I hadn't had the pleasure of. 
 There are some books/movies that divide your life in two parts; one before you've read it and the one after. Some call them ""classics"". I always thought it was too bland of a term for something so life-changing. They ought to be called Crossroads(or something). Those who haven't read it travel a whole other path than those who have. This is one of those books. 
 What can I say about the story that hasn't been said already? How can I explain how Harper Lee manifested this gem of a human being- Atticus Finch? If I look at it objectively, I think only a person with Daddy-issues can write a book like this. But then, she just might be a bloody good writer. I could sit here for hours together dissecting every character and explaining to you every line, character and their significance. But, how do I describe this feeling that is too... intangible for words?

 It took me quite a while to read and re-read each pages properly, as some of the events unfold in a subtle way and requires a bit of guesswork. 
 One of the most major theme is about the racist issue (black/white equality). 
 A strange thing... is that.. why almost each character has its nickname? That is kinda weird, but perhaps the short nickname makes story-writing easier. 
 The spoiler below is the reason for 5 star rating, and that the good story flow and character built-up credits much to it. 
 (view spoiler)[IMO, my favourite part of the book is the court scene, about tom's trial. I was hoping that Atticus could be change the racist mindset but ""Guilty"" formed the majority vote.

There's a lot of charm, as it's told through the point of view of a perceptive child. Scout has internalized the casual racism and sexism of her culture, but even a 9-year-old can see when things are wrong or unjust. 
 I really enjoyed the language and flow of this book. It pulled me along in a nice way, and I'm glad I read it. But speaking as a reader who prefers high stakes and lots of action, this was a real change of pace. It's sort of like the movie ""A Christmas Story."" It's a vignette of childhood. An interesting childhood, in a culture that no longer really exists, but still a laid-back and meandering type of tale. 
 To me, some of the dialogue sounded too scripted, like 1950s-1960s movies. Especially towards the end, as Scout draws some conclusions, she sounds a little too graciously adult. I have trouble believing that a 9-year-old would regularly say things like, ""Won't you sit down, Mrs. Merryweather?"" even in the 1930s. 
 Anyway, aside from that, this book gave me a warm, fuzzy feeling. It's nice to see that some things haven't changed about us humans, no matter what culture we're in.

 I read this book in high school. But, as a person of 15, I couldn't truly appreciate the story until I had more life experience. In high school I thought the book was boring and I just didn't see what the ""big deal"" about it was. Re-reading it nearly 10 years later, I now understand and believe it is one of the best books ever written. 
 ""'Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.'"" (page 119) 
 Jean Louise Finch (Scout) is a typical little girl living in the small fictional town of Maycomb in Alabama. She enjoys a childhood of overalls and roughing it with her older brother, Jem, and her young love, Dill, when he comes to stay with a neighbour in the summer. When she isn't thinking up ways to get a peek at Boo Radley, a mysterious figure that hides in his house, she is getting life lessons from her neighbour Miss Maudie, her family's cook, Calipurnia, or her father and role model, Atticus. But Scout's childlike innocence is lost as she learns cruel life lessons about the differences between rich and poor, good and evil, and right and wrong. In addition to the regular growing pains every person goes through as they mature, Scout learns about old stereotypes and cruelties that exist following the civil war in the south. Atticus is a lawyer and takes on a case to defend Tom Robinson, a black man that stands accused of raping a young white woman. Scout learns of the injustices and inequalities that exist and is shocked and confused at what she experiences as her father is tormented for defending a black man. This is a coming of age story told in the most tragic fashion but is a classic through and through. 
 Before I started to re-read this book, I knew I would feel a lot differently about it now than I did in high school, but I wasn't sure to what extent. And I can honestly say I appreciate the book so much more now as an adult. It's a story that I think everyone should read. When I was in grade 10, I could not appreciate this book nearly as much as I do now. Forgive my teenage ignorance, but I just didn't get the point. I didn't understand. But I do now. 
 In it's own way, the book is tragically beautiful. When I was younger, I thought the story was merely about racial inequality, but I now realize it is so much more than that. It is about children growing up in a society where racial prejudice exists and childlike innocence meets the cruelty of mankind. In a way, it teaches the lesson that ignorance is bliss. And once you gain more knowledge, life can be difficult to understand and you can be left wondering what kind of world we live in. 
 Because this is a classic, I don't want to bother talking about the writing style or the character development (even though the book passes both of my main categories with flying colours) and I want to delve more into the story because I am amazed at how much I love this book after reading it for a second time! 
 When you're in high school, you learn about symbolism and how important it is to classic literature. The green light in The Great Gatsby. The concept of ""big brother"" in 1984. Simon in The Lord of The Flies. But in my mind, you can't truly appreciate symbolism until you are older. At the end of the day, you can take what your teacher explicitly tells you is symbolic about a novel. You can write an essay about what THEY tell you is symbolic about the novel. But when you are older and you re-read a symbolic novel, you can take your own symbolism from it. And that's what I did this time. 
 I was always perplexed about what Boo Radley was supposed to represent. Why should we care about some creepy, mysterious creature who Scout and Jem are terrified and curious of? They are curious about Boo, but terrified at the same time. I can say that Boo represents maturity. Boo remains a curiosity to the children until the end of the story. Once they ""come to terms"" with Boo (I don't want to give anything away in case people haven't read this... but I'm sure most people have read this book.), they are arguably a lot more mature and in a sense have come of age by the end of the novel after what happens. In my mind, that is what Boo represents. 
 Next is the perplexing symbol, the mockingbird. Note the quote I use, as said by Miss Maudie to Scout. Most people have argued that the mockingbird represents Boo and Tom Robinson because they are both innocent and wouldn't hurt anything so it is a sin to kill them. In my mind, however, it represents childhood innocence. It is a sin to kill that childlike innocence. In this way, the world is corrupted because we destroy the innocence of children every day by imposing society's expectations, norms, etc onto children. Such is the case in the novel. It is sad that childlike innocence is being killed. For instance, Scout and Jem go to the jail to see Atticus, who is waiting outside the jail to protect Tom Robinson from citizens of the town that wish to do him harm. When a group of men come to harm Tom, they are about to hurt Atticus as well to get him out of the way before the children step in. Scout doesn't seem to know what is happening so she strikes up conversation with her neighbours as if they were visitors for tea. She doesn't understand why they are so angry but she carries on her witty banter. Eventually the small mob leaves, probably because they are taken aback by how innocent Scout is and they don't want to do anything wrong in the presence of the children. The children are also horrified at the cruelty of mankind when they witness Tom Robinson's trial. And those are just some of the examples by which the childrens' innocence is killed throughout the story. 
 So if you have never read this book, or have even not read it for several years, personally I advise you to read it again. It is a flawless story.","Tue Jun 10 12:52:21 -0700 2014","Thu Jan 21 10:20:33 -0800 2016","","",0,0

 To Kill a Mockingbird was one of the first novels I read in high school that I actually remember. At first, I didn't want to read it, but as the story progressed I found that the novel was intriguing, and I wanted to find out what happened next and see what the characters would do. I tend to enjoy classics. I won't say I enjoy them all because there are a few that I wish I never read, but I love the messages that they send and what the books focus on. Classics are a way to look at the past without a history book. A reader can find out all kinds of things about a certain time period by just reading some novels written during that time. I love how To Kill a Mockingbird and other classics open a window into the past, and I will continue to read classics as should others.

 I don't think there is any other book on Goodreads that has been reviewed by so many of my friends. Most of my friends just plugged in a star value instead of a review. Out of almost 25 ratings, there are only two reviews! Even I used to have a star rating for the book before I deleted it a few years ago, unsure if I'd even read the think. HAVE I ever read To Kill a Mockingbird? I was supposed to. Everyone was. But I don't think I actually did. As I read the book, everything I remembered was from the movie, which admittedly I watched a lot as a child. But anything that wasn't in the movie was completely new to me. 
 I (re?)read Mockingbird in preparation for the ""new"" Harper Lee novel in a couple of weeks. And I liked it. It has that classic Southern feel, complete with complicated Southern lineage (I learned that a ""double cousin"" is a real thing. I thought that was just a joke from True Blood), steamy Southern weather and problematic racism. But it goes a bit deeper into the racial dynamic of the time than I expected it to, with thoughts that are surprisingly modern for the time (except for the help, Calpurnia's view on ""talking black."") Hell, the way things are going in the United States today, To Kill a Mockingbird still feels relevant. 
 It's an enjoyable read, even if it is a bit uneven. ""Part One"" is episodic in nature and feels like an entirely different book from ""Part Two"" which has a traditional plot structure. Part One is more enjoyable, mainly due to the presence of Dill (who is a much deeper and more interesting character than his role as ""comic relief"" in the movie; I felt for him when he realized his own mother doesn't really want him), and Part Two gets a little too didactic with its politics, but I guess that's how you win a Pulitzer Prize. The title and bird symbolism is heavy handed and doesn't really make any sense. Also, Atticus is so goddamn ""good"" he borders on naive and ridiculous at times. Atticus calls Mrs. Dubose ""the bravest person [he] ever knew,"" which is an incorrect assessment of an evil, hateful old woman, and tells Scout, about Boo Radley, ""Most people are [real nice] when you finally see them."" Um, except for Bob Ewell, who just tried to kill two children. I understand he says ""most people"" but that's a weird note to end a book about injustice on. In fact, the whole Boo Radley portions, while entertaining in the beginning, are the weakest part of the book. He's absent for most of the stronger second half before sweeping in to save the day and disappear again with no explanation. 
 Anyway, despite my criticisms taking up the majority of space in this review, it isn't a negative one. The book has a strong voice and clever sense of humor (maybe it's Truman Capote's ha ha) I'm glad we have many more diverse voices to choose from today, but To Kill a Mockingbird is still relevant in its way.","Wed Jul 01 05:42:47 -0700 2015","Sat Jul 11 13:18:43 -0700 2015","Thu Jul 02 00:00:00 -0700 2015","Wed Jul 01 00:00:00 -0700 2015",1,0

 As soon as I finished it, I picked it back up and re-read it. 
 This was the first novel I can think of that gave me an intense roller-coaster ride of emotion. The characters are realistic and relatable. There's mystery. There's suspense. There's heartbreak and anguish and parts that make me so mad I want to spit. But that's what a good book does to you. It makes you feel things and think about the world you live in. 
 The story is from the perspective of Scout Fitch, a tomboy living with her father Attics, and her brother Jem in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama. The two children befriend a boy named Dill, who comes to Maycomb each summer to stay with his Aunt. The book is a coming-of-age tale focusing on three children's misunderstanding of the world and people around them. They learn about prejudice, racism, but most importantly they learn not to judge others. 
 I found To Kill a Mockingbird to be an accessible book for readers about 13-14+ years old. There are many wonderful things to take away from this beautifully written and haunting story. I highly recommend it.","Sun Sep 01 15:09:47 -0700 2013","Fri Oct 07 14:40:47 -0700 2016","","",0,0

 April 1 
 It's funny how things can change. I recall really liking this book the first time I read it back in about 8th grade. Maybe I should have just left well enough alone. It was a pleasant memory from my youth. Why spoil things by picking it up again as a more clear-sighted (some might say jaundiced)adult? I probably wouldn't view my favorite book from 4th grade, The Secret Weapon, the same way either. The intense drama of a glue-fingered benchwarmer called in at the end of the big game to catch the winning touchdown might seem shallow and contrived to the current me. 
 I realize I'm swimming against the tide here, but how many of you have reread this supposed masterpiece in your more mature years? With that perspective, I can't be the only one to see Scout as the rather obvious wish-fulfillment of Harper Lee. Reading since infancy, brave as any boy, inherently fair-minded, a noble spirit well beyond her years... C'mon, Harper; you've got to give her some flaws mere humans can relate to. Now Jem, in comparison, was a run-of-the-mill dullard. As written, he's not necessarily going to grow up to be the depraved male in a Lifetime movie, but it's clear that Ms. Lee doesn't much care for this kid with the penis. And Dill? How can we not think of him as the future Truman Capote, fat and affected? 
 My real problem with the book, though, now that my blinkers are off, is the pure perfection of Atticus. His progressivity knows no bounds. You're going to tell me that a lawyer is capable of empathy and integrity?!? And where is the complexity of context, you might ask. Wouldn't this son of the South, to be at all realistic, have wrestled a grudge match against himself, his Doppelcracker, if you will? Even modern-day hacks know to include that much conflict. 
 Clearly, Atticus is a balm to assuage white guilt for a nasty racial past, but I wonder if that by itself qualifies as clothes for the emperor. Ironically, people who are happy to applaud the courage Atticus displayed in standing against popular sentiment will likely castigate me for doing the same.

 All I could say is that 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is a really book, not to mention, how honest the language of this book is. Its good to read something that really depicts how unfair the society becomes when racism is involved in cases just like Tom Robinson's case here in this book. 
 This book is either something you read as required in a subject at school or just happened to catch your attention on some ways. I am telling you that this book is very realistic and true to its readers. Maybe Harper Lee is some kind of a peace seeking person and that would be nice to know. 
 It emphasizes how people should perceive things, if they're right or wrong it also focuses that people should follow the law, or do what is right. Besides, just from the titular quote: ""Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird"" indicates this message. 
 I learned a lot from it, though being so classic-in-style-but-not-too-much, I enjoyed it. Besides look: 
 It talks a lot about courage and real things.","Fri Mar 28 09:14:33 -0700 2014","Fri Apr 04 05:27:19 -0700 2014","Thu Apr 03 00:00:00 -0700 2014","Tue Apr 01 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0

 Finally read this eloquent & affecting masterpiece; I've no idea why I never read it as a child. I think it should required reading for children. 
 Scout is a delight and I love her spirit. Also I really identify with Jem's inability to understand how people he believes are good could make such an unjust & biased decision. I've felt that reaction - although thankfully not about anything of such importance - and it is indeed gut wrenching and fills you with such anger and disgust. Atticus and the other characters were wonderful as well.","Sat Jan 08 17:52:31 -0800 2011","Fri Feb 06 13:10:57 -0800 2015","Sun Jan 04 00:00:00 -0800 2015","Mon Sep 29 00:00:00 -0700 2014",0,0

Her father protects her innocence by giving her no more information than necessary (His name is Atticus, like the rhetor) and by showing her the parts of his actions that could be perceived as kind. Yet... 
 I am unsure that Go Set A Watchman is a re-telling of the Mockingbird story. Here's why: 
 1. Miss Maudie says that Atticus is doing what others not dare do when he tries to help Tom Robinson win his case. 2. Atticus thinks that Tom had a chance in appeal. 3. The black community stands up as Atticus leaves the courtroom. 4. Judge Tate seems to believe/know that Tom is innocent of rape. 5. Aunt Alexandra acts like she doesn'the understand her brother, but she has left her home on the Landing to support her brother and his family. These things could fit within the construction. Yet the people gathered at Helen Robinson's house gave way to Atticus in Mockingbird while in Watchman, the people gathered there were to some degree angry/frustrated/resentful. With her intuitive ways, she would have sensed any dark emotions or actions when she accompanied Atticus. 
 IMHO, this Mockingbird book is a different book from Watchman. Apparently theyou are related, but are they necessarily the same story with watchman telling more of the truth? As a writer, I know that some days I see the situation from one perspective and other stiles from another perspective. The books don'the have to match up, so I am choosing/deciding for myself that these are two different books. It is art. It is open to interpretation.","Sun Nov 30 21:35:36 -0800 2014","Thu Sep 29 22:32:42 -0700 2016","Sat Apr 03 00:00:00 -0800 1982","Thu Apr 01 00:00:00 -0800 1982",0,0

 Unfortunately, my wife didn't like it that much. She had read summary that said the book was about the trial of a black man who had been wrongfully accused, and she was disappointed that the book took soooo long to get to the point. WRONG. 
 This book is not about a trail, it is a time capsule or a snippet of American life. To me, it accomplishes this beautifully. This book is not about it's plot; it's the atmosphere, the beautiful prose that brings rural life in Alabama of the 1930s to life.

 I just found that the writing was too old for me to be bothered with it, was too stuck in the mud english and I wasn't interested in it as I thought I would be... I appreciate what she writes about, the racisim, sexism and all that is so so so important. And I want to praise the fact that she actually wrote it, a lot of authors miss it out to not annoy people, but I just don't like it. I'm glad I went and bought it, and kind of showed myself what I was missing or not missing as I think this may be.

 It is a story of how life isn't always fair, told from the innocent perspective of a young girl. 
 I love this story! Much earlier this year I had to write an essay on the movie To Kill a Mockingbird. I'd never seen it before and had no interest in seeing it. Finally, the night before the paper was due, I sat down and watched it. It was so powerful. The acting was amazing and the story was so real. I quickly whipped out an essay about it, and my teacher loved it. I was the only one in my class who liked the movie. 
 The book was a billion times better (if that's possible). The narrative was so perfect. I felt like I was there in every moment.

 When teaching difficult literature, the teacher should approach it in a mature, educated & responsible way. The racial themes should be addressed in a sensitive & age appropriate way. I firmly believe every country, province/state, city & community has their own racial tensions. After so many generations & centuries, it's still a widespread global problem. Books like this are fantastic for introducing these difficult topics to today's children in an accessible, challenging way. 
 If we stop reading these milestone books, how can we develop empathy or introduce meaningful conversations about racism that still plagues our society? Well written novels such as this one, are a great way to explore racial themes in a deep & meaningful way. 
 Book banning & censorship is something I'm firmly against except in very rare, exceptional occasions. This book includes themes that are commonly brought up in social discussions or heated debates at a dinner table.

 Wonderfully written, To Kill a Mockingbird represents you a story about life. Eight years old girl tells us in her own way that life is not only about black and white. Sometimes, you find gray things in life. You can't change them, all you have to do is trying your best to treat them. 
 It has been a long time since a book can influence me this much. Setting in Montgomery County in 1960, To Kill a Mockingbird gently teaches you about life and human being. It will change your view about the world and its people. People said not to judge a book by its cover, but do you? Everyone have their own prejudice about others and it's very normal. But please never let your prejudice become first than your mind. You never know if your white thing is actually a black thing.

Not really. The fact that Watchman came out only insures that I review this book now, and not a month, or a year from now. Yet, because of the tremendous amount of hype surrounding the new book, I couldn't help but hear some things about it, despite my best intentions. I usually try to go into a book could, only going into other reviews when I can't seem to decide what to make of the novel I just read. In the case of To Kill a Mockingbird then, my viewpoint on this novel hasn't really changed, despite some of the controversial things that occur in Watchman. 
 As with my Hunger Games review, I don't think that my review of this novel is absolutely necessary. With this novel, that statement holds even more weight. This story has become so interwoven into the American culture over the past 50 years that I'm surprised a beer cooler that says ""I *heart* 'Merica"", with the heart dressed up to look like the American flag no less, doesn't come with every purchase. This novel does teach about the racism of the south during the 1930's, but it also teaches about empathy, and has more moral lessons than you can shake a stick at, which is perhaps the best portion of the novel. 
 These many moral lessons come to the novel because of Scout, the main character. Because she is the main character, there are many more moral platitudes that she is told by her father Atticus. Because she is a child, she is still learning about things like empathy and how to work with others in different social settings. Her brother Jem is also an awesome character. This is really a coming of age story for him, more so for Scout. He goes from a boy at the beginning if the story who reenacts plays with his little sister, to a man who understands the racism of his hometown, and how black people are treated unfairly. 
 One advantage that I like is that many different lessons that are taught by Atticus, are not simply there for the reading audience, they are actually exhibited in the novel, later on. For example, in one scene, Atticus explains to Scout about empathy, with his now famous words about how you can't know what someone is going through until you get into their skin and walk around in it. What I like is this plays back on the novel later on, when Mr. Ewell spits on him after the trial. Atticus allows this to happen because, from Ewell's point of view, Atticus destroyed any reputation he had left. This empathy shows that Atticus knows how to not only talk the talk, but also walk the walk. 
 I have heard some critics say that Atticus is a character who does not seem real, and who is more comparable to a shining knight whom we all should look up to. I think this is both correct, and incorrect. Yes, he is put into a positive light, but I believe that this is only because of the fact that Scout, the main character is a woman writing about her time as a child. When one is a child, everything seemed to be nicer and better, especially in hindsight. Scout may be showing us the side of Atticus that she wants us to see, and that she saw herself. Atticus may have not wanted to let others see his worry and self doubt about his job and the Tom Robinson case. Regardless, this character was one whom I really enjoyed, and is someone who I want to read about next in Watchman. 
 I think that this novel is an excellent story about life in a small southern town, told from the viewpoint of a child. Despite the language, which some may find difficult to get into, I thought it was humorous and very entertaining. The only time I was confused by the text was when the text mentioned southern slang for certain items. I still think that it was very well written, especially the phonetic spelling of the language. It made for a very good read, and it is one I won't soon forget. I give it a five out of five.","Mon Jul 13 12:59:49 -0700 2015","Fri Jul 21 17:04:08 -0700 2017","Wed Jul 22 00:00:00 -0700 2015","Mon Jul 13 00:00:00 -0700 2015",0,0

The underlying message of To Kill a Mockingbird is simple, straightforward and frequently employed throughout Harper Lee's classic novel. It's a good message, and for those who might find it banal and overused, it's one that we as a society have still clearly not learned in the last 55 years. There isn't much complexity in this book, but Lee executes everything to perfection, from her portrayal of curious, open-minded Scout to meticulous, wise and just Atticus to the hypocrisies and prejudices of their fellow Maycomb County residents. It's an easy read, but it seems every page contains one shining truism. And yet for all the obvious arguments in favor of giving every person the benefit of the doubt and granting equality for all, there is some question as to whether Lee sees those rights extending to woman. The clash of tomboy Scout with her Aunt Alexandra and the supposed civilized ladies is a recurrent theme throughout. But then Lee writes of the qualifications for rape ""Apparently you had to kick and holler, you had to be overpowered and stomped on, preferable knocked stone cold."" This is Scout's rendition of how her brother describes rape, so there is the strong possibility of irony here, but this definition hardly encompasses the nuances of sexual violence rightly understood by contemporary law, where a victim may not offer physical resistance, yet still feel violated. Later, Atticus tells Scout ""There's nothing more sickening to me than a low-grade white man who'll take advantage of a Negro's ignorance,"" followed two paragraphs later by ""Miss Maudie can't sit on a jury because she's a woman."" The juxtaposition should be obvious to a modern reader, which raises questions about Lee's intent in these scenes. Is she merely stating the legal standing of the times, ignorant of their implications for the rights of woman? Or does Lee's social critique extend to gender equality, woven into the backdrop of a novel overtly promoting racial equality? I'm inclined to believe the latter. Whatever Lee's intentions, this reading makes To Kill a Mockingbird a far more complex book, forcing the reader to consider Tom Robinson's rape trial more carefully and chipping away at Atticus' moral sainthood. In either case, To Kill A Mockingbird deserves to be read for its deft and powerful betrayal of the pitfalls of prejudice.","Sun Feb 16 15:47:34 -0800 2014","Sat May 16 09:10:23 -0700 2015","Sat May 16 12:31:37 -0700 2015","Mon May 04 00:00:00 -0700 2015",1,0

I read this for school and had been meaning to read this for a while; it being a classic and all. I can't say that I was as impressed as I felt I should have been, since both of the ninth grade English teachers(and my sixth grade teacher)at my school claim it as their favorite novel. 
 The characters were alright. The main protagonist, Scout, I found to be lacking. I was hoping to feel the youthfulness radiating out of her, creating a refreshing view on the subject. Although her age was a main element of the story, it just didn't create the feeling that it should have. I did, however, really enjoy the character of Atticus Finch. He was an interesting father and an even more interesting lawyer. And of course there was the mysterious figure, Boo Radley. 
 As for the plot of this story, there really was none until the second half of the book. Part one of the book was filled with various short stories about the children and their everyday life, which could have been interesting, but unfortunately were pretty boring. I have heard from my classmates, though, that they loved the book specifically for part two. I can agree that part two, especially the court scene, was pretty enjoyable. The topic of racism was strong, and I found myself constantly questioning the ways of southern life after the end of slavery, but before the end of prejudice. The ending of the story, though, which was supposed to reveal the entire point of the story(so I had heard), didn't hit as hard as it could/should have. 
 Overall, this book did explore an interesting view of the past, and the issues of racism, and prejudice. The title of the book also brought up some important symbolism. I will say that this book is not on the top of my list of favorite classics, mainly because I found it too simplistic. Maybe I didn't read it correctly. I'll probably try this book again in a few years.","Fri Oct 03 19:11:29 -0700 2014","Sun Dec 28 08:28:45 -0800 2014","Sun Dec 28 08:28:45 -0800 2014","Fri Dec 26 00:00:00 -0800 2014",1,0

Peck's impeccable portrayal of Atticus Finch has always stuck in my head. As I was reading the book, many scenes of that film kept coming back, but I already forgot how the story ends. 
 The story still moves me deeply, as the themes of human compassion, parenting, friendship, racial prejudices and class discrimination are evocatively explored. The voice of the narrator as a nine-year-old girl makes the story all the more endearing. 
 These quotes of Atticus's impress me most: 
 ""You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."" 
 ""They're certainly entitled to think that, and they're entitled to full respect for their opinions. But before I can live with other folks, I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience."" 
 Perhaps this passage is the most striking in the whole book for its piercing poignancy: 
 (view spoiler)[""Atticus had used every tool available to free men to save Tom Robinson, but in the secret courts of men's hearts Atticus had no case. Tom was a dead man the minute Mayella Ewell opened her mouth and screamed."" (hide spoiler)] 
 However, what really gets to me is the ending, which was disquieting enough to make me take away one star. Heck Tate's (the sheriff's) decision (view spoiler)[to falsify Bob Ewell's cause of death in order to protect Boo (Arthur) Radley from being charged (hide spoiler)] is obviously based on a flawed reasoning. But Atticus's (view spoiler)[ultimate acquiescence to it (hide spoiler)] seems to overturn (view spoiler)[the very principles of honesty that he has been fighting so hard to uphold, both as a lawyer and as a parent (hide spoiler)].

 This is one of those books that is famous enough that a review from someone like me will disappear into the dust, so I'll leave the real reviewing to the real reviewers. 
 I have to admit, most of the book's attraction for me after the midway point was the character of Atticus-he is almost the polar opposite of my own dad, who contradicts me and then laughs at me when I explain the danger of Beijing flooding due to global warming. And while Atticus's strong sense of justice has its ups and downs for his children, I'd be happy nevertheless, focussing on the assets. 
 I fell asleep during the first few chapters. Especially when I read the first page, and it seemed so, how do I say this, American. Football. Southern towns. And while I have nothing against Americans, it gets aggravating when pretty much every single book you read takes place in a setting unfamiliar to you. 
 So I fell asleep partly because of that, and partly because the atmosphere is sleepy and quiet and the first half of the book basically chronicles the 'adventures' of a small-town girl half my age with a bookish father. 
 I kept going, because, well, I had to. Somewhere along the road someone decided that the study of this particular book had to be implanted in every. Ninth-grade. English. Course. Then things got more interesting: I soaked in every single word of the trial of Tom Robinson-will not go into details for fear of spoilers-and what proceeded it was absolutely unexpected, (or maybe not so much, considering how utterly realistic Harper Lee gets), which makes it expected for me. In well-written books, I must expect the unexpected. 
 What happened after that only intensifies the ethical struggle when the town is split into two sides: those who believe in equal rights and those who take on the infamous attitude of the south. What is obvious to us these days never reached the thoughts of most of the jury, the Maycomb residents. 
 One qualm, I think, is the role of Dill in this story. His character seemed to have no greater purpose in the plot than sparking Scout's curiosity and acting as a friend to her and Jem. He was an interesting character and I would've liked to see him adopt a greater role. 
 The writing itself is amazing-Lee has a major talent for narrating. 
 Also the slightly abrubt ending seems to rest uneasily with the other reviewers on this site. I'm wondering if Harper Lee simply wanted to end it there, or if it was because she couldn't think of a way to wrap it up. Probably the former. 
 A/N: Other people have mentioned their non-appreciation of this book when they were in high school, apparantly because they were in high school.

 To Kill a Mockingbird shows some facts from human nature, such as racism and discrimination through the eyes of a little girl. And after reading it I was marveled of how simple is life if you keep seenig things as a child.

 Set in Alabama in the 1930's, the story is told by ""Scout"" Finch, the young daughter of lawyer Atticus Finch. To say that it is the story of racist America in the 1930's would be an understatement. Yes, Atticus is defending a black man accused of raping a 19 year old white girl, but it is more than just about racism. It is about coming of age for Scout and her brother Jem. It is about ""family"" and ""neighbours"", and having a father who teaches his children right from wrong.

 First of all, the narrator of Scout is amazing. This kind of story would likely be much easier to tell from an adult's perspective as adults (sometimes) have a better understanding of the workings of the world. What makes this book unique is that Scout often sees and hears things that she can't make sense of, so you have to. And this is done in such a way as to not spell everything out for the reader either. 
 And obviously, the content of this book is incredible. What I love about this story is that it wasn't an unrealistic happily ever after. But it did end on a somewhat positive note. This book does not leave you with a sigh of relief from a perfectly resolved ending, but it leaves you with a sadness with just a hint of hope.

 I liked the fact that it was written form a child's POV. (And successfully, too.) Thing is, the younger we are, the more we see things with an innocent's eye.I liked that throughout the book, Scout never judged anyone and simply gave the facts, which allows the reader to make up his own mind. 
 I liked how Harper Lee showed us how much a child can change in only a few years. 
 I liked that HP wasn't afraid to write about taboo subjects, and I liked that she did it with enough finesse not to offense anyone. 
 To me, To kill a mockingbird is about acceptance, prejudice, and life lessons. 
 The back of my book says Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. At first, I didn't understand how it could be a love story. When I actually thought about it, though, I understood it wasn't a love story between a girl and a boy, but rather a love story between a girl and all who surround her. -Her father, her brother, her neighbors, the old lady she hated, the guy she'd never even seen and the black people.","Sat Dec 20 16:01:55 -0800 2014","Sat Dec 31 14:53:35 -0800 2016","Sun Dec 21 00:00:00 -0800 2014","",4,0

 A timeless and relevant classic that should be read by everyone at least once in their lifetime. 
 Lively, memorable characters that jump off the page and get under your skin, forcing you to look inwards and analyze yourself and your opinions. 
 It's written in such an intoxicating mixture of colloquial speech and literary beauty that by the time you're done, you're drunk on southern slang and hazy Maycomb summers. 
 WARNING: May contain spoilers. 
 <<Plot & Concept>> 
 What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? I came to it late in the game, never having it assigned in school, and being too obsessed with fantasy to pick it up on my own in those formative years. I can't say whether reading it then would have made an impact, but I can say it's made one now. In my 20's, during this tumultuous time in the media, there is a message here that is just so, so relevant. I feel everyone should either be reading or re-reading this right now. 
 It's a wonderful story that is both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. It's all about not basing an opinion on someone before you know them, based solely on the color of their skin, or their wealth, or a rumor blown out of proportion. 
 <<Characters & Relationships>> 
 TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD would be nothing without its characters. 
 Scout is an enchantingly sassy southern girl, with a brain and an opinion about everything. She's crass and full of contradictions, but she's smart and inquisitive and open to everything around her, just like we all are as kids, before the world gets to us. She's a bit of a fish out of water in her community, preferring to explore and roughhouse and wear overalls, than to wear her Sunday best and small talk with town society. She calls people out on the things they say, but she loves with a fierceness and a loyalty that surpasses all else. She's the genuine article, a classic character that will never age and always remain relevant in some form or fashion. 
 Oh, Atticus. It's because of Atticus Finch that we have Scout, and I can now finally see why so many people have idolized him for so long. As a father figure, he is perceptive in a way that most modern characters couldn't even begin to be (and real life fathers as well). He's the dad we all wished we'd had, but can still see glimmers of him in our own fathers. He's wise and kind, and challenges his children on an emotional and moral level, an area parents oftentimes seem to neglect. He treats them like tiny adults, as opposed to silly children, and it makes Scout and Jem who they are. He's incredibly brave for taking the stance he did in the era he exists in. Perhaps he has been put on a pedestal by readers, but who's to say he doesn't belong there? 
 <<Style>> 
 It's a shame Harper Lee didn't write more, but perhaps it makes TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD all the more special that she didn't. It's written in such an intoxicating mixture of colloquial speech and literary beauty that by the time you're done, you're drunk on southern slang and hazy Maycomb summers. 
 The conversational tone makes the novel fly by, but also forces you to pause and read passages over and over again to absorb the beauty and meaning of the words. Being in Scout's brain is a fascinating place to be, and I found myself reluctant to leave it and move on to other books. 
 <<Quotes>> 
 All quotes are from the 2006 Harper Perennial Modern Classics paperback edition. 
 * ""Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o'clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum."" pg. 6 
 * ""'...You want to grow up to be a lady, don't you?' 
 I said not particularly."" pg. 90 
 * ""'An' they chased him 'n' never could catch him 'cause they didn't know what he looked like, an' Atticus, when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done any of those things...Atticus, he was real nice...' 
 His hands were under my chin, pulling up the cover, tucking it around me. 
 'Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.'"" pgs. 322-323 
 And a million others. The whole book is one big, perfect quote. 
 <<Cover Love>> 
 There have been many covers over the years, and I love the classic cover of my paperback edition. The soft green, deep navy, and punchy, rusty orange are lovely to look at, and that wonderful stripey spine looks to pretty on a shelf. But I have have a fondness for these editions as well:

It's incredibly simplistic, for one thing. Mrs. Dubose's story is like an afterschool special. And it's insufferably folksy and preachy. Atticus comes off as awkwardly as Lawrence Fishburne's character in Boyz in the Hood. 
 It's aged poorly because for a book about not being racist, it comes off pretty paternalistic these days. And there are mid-20th-century books that deal with race in ways that haven't aged poorly, like Native Son, Their Eyes Were Watching God and Invisible Man.

 This is one of those classics that I have been meaning to read, but never got around to. After Harper Lee's passing, I determined that I had put it off too long. 
 I can understand how many people could be put off by the book. The first third is slow to progress, but it sets the tone and the backstory for the remaining two thirds; 1930's Alabama as seen through the eyes of a child. Racial inequality, class differences, and gender inequality are just some of the ideas portrayed by Lee, with a lot of it based on her own upbringing. 
 Jean Louise, aka Scout, so desperately wants to grow up so that she can hopefully understand what is happening in the world around her. A black man is convicted of rape, even though the evidence clearly shows he did not do it. Some children come to school while others stay home and work on the farm. The world, as seen through Scout's eyes, seems unfair and confusing. That's the point. Sometimes it takes someone as innocent as a child to point out the follies in life. 
 I don't want to rehash the entire novel, as it has been done by thousands before me. I do however feel that this is one of the most important novels of the 20th century. People may not like the language or the subject matter, but it does show life in 1930's Alabama. In order to know where we are going, it's important to know where we've been, and this novel shows us how far we have come. It is also shows us that we still have a long way to go.","Wed Mar 02 11:22:01 -0800 2016","Thu Mar 24 07:47:24 -0700 2016","Wed Mar 02 11:43:57 -0800 2016","",0,0

This novel shows the point of view a white Southern girl living in the 1930s, Scout Finch. Scout lives with her sibling, Jem, and their solitary father, Atticus, in the languid Southern town of Maycomb. In To Kill a Mockingbird, we see three important years of Scout's life; we see childhood innocence transform to corrupted adulthood. 
 Lee explores significant themes such as the coexistence of good and evil, significance of moral education, existence of social inequality, and how appearances can be deceiving. Lee shows these themes in just one court case: a young white woman, Mayella Ewell, accuses a young black man, Tom Robinson, of rape. This is where the novel gets intense. Atticus is called on to defend the defendant, Tom Robinson, and soon Scout, Jem, and their friend Dill find themselves caught up in events outside their ability to grasp.

 It's funny. Most times when I read classics like this book, Oliver Twist, War of the Worlds, Of Mice and Men, etc. etc. they always get 4 stars. I don't think that half of them even deserve that many, you know? I think I just give them 4 stars because it's a classic and all and you're SUPPOSE to like it. Not that this book is like that, because I actually liked this book. I guess because I just naturally like historical books like this. Good book. A classic classic. 
 After reading it with my class review: 
 Let me start off by saying I didn't read this book twice. I stopped reading with my class around the 29th chapter. Also, I still believe that this book is just one of those classics that everyone reads and is SUPPOSED to be good. This book I realized was just okay. When i read it in 7th grade it seemed so riveting and...mature. I think that was because of the court case and Mayella talked about the rape and stuff. But then I read that part again and realized I've read better court scenes before...I can't remember where but I have. And I just think that if Lee had made the court case longer or something and hadn't ended it the way she did this classic novel would've been right on my imaginary shelf(along with The Catcher in the Rye) titled ""Classic novels I actually really liked"".","Wed Feb 17 16:29:03 -0800 2010","Sun Nov 06 06:41:52 -0800 2011","Fri May 01 00:00:00 -0700 2009","",0,0

 It's a good story with great characters. It's hard not to like Scout or Jem, or the awesome team they're together. 
 My favorite character is Atticus, though. I felt so proud for him to be just as he is, and I understand why his children respect him so much. He is all what a good lawyer should be: loyal, smart, confident, patient. He was so focus on always doing the right thing no matter the consequences, and that's awesome! 
 I was really shocked by how strong the racism was present at the time; I believe that's the reason behind all the success of this book: it perfectly showed the social reality of that period. 
 I did enjoy the book and learn a lot from it; however, the events went at a slow pace most of the time, so I lost interest at certain moments. For me, the trial was the best part in the entire book! It had my undivided attention from beginning to end.

 I thought this was supposed to be about a black guy who gets picked on by all the intolerant white folk. Except the book never actually seemed to get there and let us meet the guy. Instead, it's just a bunch of kids playing around the neighborhood. 
 And the father... such a representation of righteousness! Smart, always on the side of good, patient...

 There isn't much to say about the story itself without ruining it for someone, sometimes nothing much happens, sometimes a lot happens, but it's not really about the events as such, more so the understanding and change that happens within Scout who is too young to understand a lot of what she sees and hears at the time.","Thu Jan 29 16:47:27 -0800 2015","Wed Feb 18 15:19:08 -0800 2015","Tue Feb 03 00:00:00 -0800 2015","",1,0

 Atticus Finch was my favorite character: calm, collected, and intellectual. On the other hand, the narrator, Scout Finch, was not one of my favorites, probably because of her naivety (though what can I expect? she's six or so). 
 I felt that the story dragged on in some places, and at other parts I wasn't sure where the plot was headed. There were more than one instance where I felt To Kill a Mockingbird just rambled around for a chapter or two. The ending was a little rushed, in my opinion. 
 Looking past some of the minor problems I had with Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, I was overall impressed and moved by her literary classic.","Thu Oct 16 16:30:07 -0700 2014","Sun Dec 07 13:34:26 -0800 2014","Tue Nov 18 12:48:22 -0800 2014","Thu Oct 16 16:30:07 -0700 2014",0,0

I have no ability to be critical or impartial reviewing it--it has become part of me after I reading it at least three times. I've seen the movie about fifty times, so the characters have been forever given faces. Atticus and Scout and Bob and Mayella Ewell are perfectly cast. It's okay in this case, because the movie is so good. 
 I think the character I enjoyed the most this time was Jem. He observant and makes some interesting discoveries about the way of the world. Of course we are seeing him through the eyes of an adoring younger sister, too, so that helps. A sleeper character who doesn't get talked about a lot is Heck Tate. He's kind of my hero in a way that Atticus isn't at the end. Atticus is surprisingly slow on the uptake.

I first picked it up when I was a naive twelve year old, my first impression being, this is definitely not a story for children. Some of the situations described--the abuse Arthur ""Boo"" Radley suffered at the hands of his father and older brother and the dialogue of the rape trial--disturbed me. At the time, I had wondered why through all those years no one offered to help Arthur escape from his situation. There were all of those neighbors, not to mention a lawyer living next door, yet everyone turned a blind eye. It seemed so cruel and unjust I couldn't understand it. I also couldn't fathom the reason why Tom Robinson felt compelled to help Mayella Ewell when it was common knowledge across the town that this family was trouble. I thought he should have known better, especially on that particular day when he noticed the house was deserted and felt that something was not quite right. Back then those negative images eclipsed all the good elements, which I now consider strengths in Harper Lee's writing. As an adult, I can now understand the emotional desperation of a young woman isolated and abused being attracted to anyone regardless of race to show affection to a man who showed her kindness and in turn for Tom to forgo social restraints to feel pity for such a girl. 
 I had to read the book again as a freshman in high school, and even though only the themes of childhood innocence and racial oppression and opposition in a small town were addressed, I began to develop a new respect for the novel and made a mental note to revisit it again. As this year marked the 50th anniversary of its publication and since TCM aired the film a couple times in the past month, I thought now would be a good time for a reread. 
 Harper Lee is a visual writer, her words paint strong images in your mind's eye--the only other author that I've come across with the same ability is Truman Capote. My favorite part of the novel is Harper's depiction of the collective mindset of a mob. The mob is not a group of individuals, but an anonymous collective sharing one goal in mind. Showing the simple fact of a child naming one person in the collective could immediately dissolve that mob mentality and turn the collective back into individuals was a depiction masterfully done. Love it! When Scout calls out, ""Hey, Mr. Cunningham."" it's like a celestial ray of light piercing through the dark cloud of mob rule and helping Mr. Cunningham and the others find their individual conscience. 
 I also like the ambiguity of the ending: Was it really murder or was it just an accident... did Bob Ewell really just trip and fall on his own knife after being pushed away by Boo Radley? Though personally, I prefer the latter version.","Wed Mar 17 09:50:28 -0700 2010","Mon Aug 23 12:22:12 -0700 2010","Sun Aug 22 00:00:00 -0700 2010","Tue Aug 17 00:00:00 -0700 2010",1,0

And I am completely surprised with that fact considering I read this book with low expectations, it was for Grade 9 English. It was ... amazing. This response is coming from a girl who commonly loves romantic-comedy or science fiction novel ONLY! I try to read different genres but it will come as a surprise to my friends that I enjoyed ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". 
 There was no epic love story or killer aliens or even an invasion and battle scene. Nay, this book was simple and focused on the fictional town of Maycomb and it's citizens, issues and pressures. Sounds boring - correct? You would be surprised. I am baffled that Harper Lee could create such a wonderful work of literature and create so well that people still read it today. I loved the descriptions in this book, it made it all seem so real. I fell in love with the characters and felt that they were developed perfectly. I especially liked the foreshadowing in this book, it made me have those moments of ""Oh, I remember that!"". My friend Chris and I were in our English class and suddenly we both screamed simutaneously, ""That was in the beginning of the book!"" Our excitement shows this is a great book. I am in Grade 9, I scream over sales and the occasional cute boy. Catch me screaming about a book written in the 1900s? Loved it! 
 I won't reveal but the ending made me squeil with delight! I loved it, a perfect ending to a perfect book. It felt ... right. Have you ever read something so beautiful that when it comes to end, you have that moment of complete appreciation for the author and book? When you just have to sit and reread the last part again, while a smile dances on your face? This is what ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" did to me. 
 I think this goes to show that our teachers and the people who create our curriculum don't assign books to us because they are sadistic and enjoy to see us get bored to death. They choose books because they want us to appreciate and fall in love with the same novel they did. 
 Go read ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". Even though I have to write an essay for it, nonetheless it has made one of my favourites. 
 P.S By the way, this book does not have anything to do with the actual killing of a mockingbird but when you find those references to the tile, it'll be worth it.","Sat Apr 03 15:01:48 -0700 2010","Fri Dec 16 18:41:49 -0800 2011","Fri Dec 16 00:00:00 -0800 2011","Thu Dec 01 00:00:00 -0800 2011",1,0

 THIS BOOK IS AMAZING 
 This book man, this book. This is surprisingly one of my new favorites. I say this because, well its a classic for a reason. This book covers so many topics from prejudice; civil rights; racism; defining bravery; maturity; feminine vs. masculine; gender roles; effects of the mob mentality; perception; inconsistency of humanity; integrity to the love inside a family home. 
 Starting off I thought this was going to be about killing an actual Mockingbird as I assume most do when they pick up this novel. But to my unexpected delight it starts off with Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch. Who is about to turn 6. The story goes through her life in Maycomb Alabama in 1933. Her family includes her father who she calls by his first name Atticus, her older brother Jem and their cook but mother-like-figure Calpurnia. 
 The story begins with Scout, Jem, and their neighbor Dill who become obsessed with their mysterious neighbor, ""Boo"" Radley. They take up their time daring each other to run up and touch the side of the house or knock on the window while trying to go unnoticed. But the story takes a quick turn when it changes from innocent kids messing with their neighbor to prejudice, people getting hurt, and people dying because of it. 
 Right off the bat you realize the maturity of scout and her education being much higher than any of her classmates. So that made the book so much better for me at the start. I have never read a book about the impertinent behavior of adult towards children. Especially since shes so mature to recognize that her father would never ask much of her so when shes asked to do something she does it. 
 I loved the rest of the Finch family as well. Of course Atticus is my favorite and is if not the best, then a very good role model for parents everywhere. As always I'm going to show how meaningful this book was to me through quotes so starting it off with Scout: 
 ""You gonna give me a chance to tell you? I don't mean to sass you, I'm just tryin' to tell you."" Uncle Jack sat down on the bed. His eyebrows came together and he peered up at me from under them. ""Proceed,"" he said. I took a deep breath. ""Well, in the first place you never stopped to gimme a chance to tell you my side of it-you just lit right into me. When Jem an' I fuss Atticus doesn't ever just listen to Jem's side of it, he hears mine too,..."" Page 97. This quote is as glorious for Jean Louise as it is for Atticus. Not only did a 6 year old girl have more maturity than most adults but it shows what a great father Atticus is. Treating both of his children fairly and knowing how to handle a difficult situation. 
 ""Aunt Alexandra looked across the room at me and smiled. She looked at a tray of cookies on the table and nodded at them. I carefully picked up the tray and watched myself walk to Mrs. Merriweather. With my very best company manners, I asked her if she would have some. After all, if Aunty could be a lady at a time like this, so could I."" Page 271. YEAH! YOU GO SCOUT! 
 Lets move on to Atticus: 
 ""Scout,"" said Atticus, ""nigger-lover is just one of those terms that don't mean anything--like snot-nose. It's hard to explain--ignorant, trashy people use it when they think somebody's favoring Negroes over and above themselves. It's slipped into usage with some people like ourselves, when they want a common, ugly term to label somebody."" 
 ""You aren't really a nigger-lover, then, are you?"" 
 ""I certainly am. I do my best to love everybody... I'm hard put, sometimes--baby, it's never an insult to be called what somebody thinks is a bad name. It just shows you how poor that person is, it doesn't hurt you."" 
 Okay side note: In chapter 12 when Calpurnia takes them to church and they shut them in I just feel like they would never do that now. Like people would sue and freak out. Even if it was for a good cause. This scene is just so bizarre to me and unbelievable but amazing because even though they're basically blackmailing these people in the church its for a good cause. 
 It's so sad that Calpurnia cant remember how old she is or when her birthday is so she just has it on Christmas cause its easier to remember. 
 Sweet, sweet little innocent Dill: 
 ""It was just him I couldn't stand,"" Dill said. [...] ""That old Mr. Gilmer doin' him thataway, talking so hateful to him--[...] It was the way he said it made me sick, plain sick. [...] The way that man called him 'boy' all the time an' sneered at him, an' looked around at the jury every time he answered-[...] It ain't right, somehow it ain't right to do 'em that way. Hasn't anybody got any business talkin' like that--it just makes me sick."" 
 ""Jack! When a child asks you something, answer him, for goodness' sake. But don't make a production of it. Children are children, but they can spot an evasion quicker than adults, and evasion simply muddles 'em. No,"" my father mused, ""you had the right answer this afternoon, but the wrong reasons. Bad language is a stage all children go through, and it dies with time when they learn they're not attracting attention with it. Hotheadedness isn't. Scout's got to learn to keep her head..."" Page 99. I think adults underestimate children. They think kids can't possibly understand the ""adult world"" well I think if they're asking, they deserve an answer. 
 Chapter 11 page 124 what Atticus says here is gold. Its also 26:43 for audio book 
 The voice of the audio book is perfect 
 Atticus getting the food from the family and crying ruined me 
 chapter 23 Atticus is a boss 
 at the end of chapter 23 is actually pretty sad because Jem is saying that boo Radley shut himself up in his house because he wants to stay inside because people arnt nice to eachother 
 ""Mrs. Merriweather was one of those childless adults to find it necessary to assume a different tone of voice when speaking to children.""Page 264. I think we all this the problem here. Oh and heres another: Sulky dark person. Speaking like they're a pest, that is so awful. ""just ruins your day"" sickening. 
 I still wonder, why Tom decided to climb the fence in jail. Wasn't he safe in there? Or do you think the people in jail would think he raped the girl or do they know like everyone else it was clearly the father. It said the cops shot him 17 times and what seems to me like police brutality. Like they believe he raped her and they just needed an excuse to shoot him. Like I know the story says he was trying to climb the fence but that's just what one of the characters said. It could be that is what they said because one of the cops in the jail shot at Tom and now they're trying to cover it up with ""oh no he was escaping."" I don't know maybe I'm completely off and Tom knew he had no chance so for him the only answer was suicide and he knew just how to make it happen. 
 A lot of this book is kind of like art - it may not be pretty but is suppose to make you feel something. 
 At the end of the chapter scout sees her aunt acting through the pain so she says after all if auntie could be a lady at a time like this so could i. shows the maturity. also shows scout realizing the aunt isn't that bad after all 
 I love how the story of the kids being fascinated with the Radley house got thrown out and switches to Tom's predicament back to the Radley in the end. it did a 180 
 25 
 this is the quote that is what the book is about 
 ""He likened Tom's death to the senseless slaughter of songbirds-..."" page 275 
 at the time that mr ewell said one down 2 more to go i thought he was talking about toms famiyl but he was talking about jem and scout :<< 
 27 
 ewell attacks and the aunt gives scout the overalls 
 Boo Radley lmao 
 boo had given Jem and scout so much ""...we had given him nothing and it made me sad"" NOOOO 
 Now some random parts of the book I loved/spoke to me/made me think: 
 I don't see Mayella being the victim at all

It's taken me so long to write a review (about 2-3 months) because it is just such a hard book to write about. It's one of those books where not much happens big so much happens at the same time, if that makes sense. The majority of the book is made up of scenes of the characters playing and doing things insignificant but at the same time, so many themes of prejudice and injustice are brought up. I hold this author in very high regards. 
 To Kill a Mockingbird (although you probably already know) is set in the southern states of the US and focuses around a young girl called Scout. The author, Harper Lee, explores adult issues of race and class during the thirties through the ideas of Scout and her brother Jem. Atticus, the children's father, try to teach them morals and attitudes whilst defending a case in which he knows he won't win, a black man charged with raping a white girl. 
 The one thing that most people don't expect when it comes to this book is the humour. It is hilarious! There is so much humour woven into the story which brings a lightness to a rather heavy subject matter. I caught myself laughing a loud many times which totally breaks the stereotype of all classics being overly boring and overrated. 
 Another aspect that the author wrote really well is the relatability of the characters. Living in Australia, I have no idea about the cultural context of this story. Its embarrassing to admit that I know little to none about the civil law and everything that followed. Despite this, I was able to relate and connect to each one of these characters even if I had no idea the significance of what they were going to. I was able to see someone I know or even parts of myself in each of these very easily recognisable characters. I really loved this. 
 As I mentioned before, the context of the book is so foreign to me and yet despite that I can say that the message really hits home. Messages of equality, justice and the criticism of prejudice are so strong in this book and I can compare them to what the world is going through right now. The anti-judgement in this book is so compassionate and beautiful and relates to everyday life. Do. Not. Judge. It's as simple as that and nobody can express the message as eloquently and beautifully as Harper Lee. 
 This is definitely a book that everyone should read at least once in their lifetime.","Thu Mar 12 03:04:40 -0700 2015","Fri Mar 03 00:55:53 -0800 2017","Sat Oct 01 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Tue Sep 27 00:00:00 -0700 2016",1,0

 ""Atticus, he was real nice."" 
 ""Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them."" 
 To Kill a Mockingbird takes place in a small country town in America during the Great Depression. It tells the story of Atticus Finch, a lawyer and single father to Jem and Scout (the narrator.) The story unfolds over two years and covers a number of themes - injustice, compassion, racism and loss of innocence to name a few. 
 This is a great classic. The writing was wonderful. It is told from the perspective of a child, Scout, who brings a lot of charm and honesty to the story without it being overly childish. You really feel like you are growing up with the kids as the story progresses. I had a few minor issues with it though - one being that the timeline seemed a bit off in certain parts and the first and second half seemed rather disconnected from each other. I also would have loved to have known more about Boo Radley. 
 I was taken aback by the racism that is a constant theme through out the book. I couldn't imagine people being treated as if they were not human beings because of their color. I would say it is a decent portrayal of the prejudices against African Americans at the time, but i'm sure in reality it was far worse 
 Overall I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone.","Sat Feb 11 23:34:54 -0800 2017","Thu Mar 16 00:53:22 -0700 2017","Wed Feb 22 02:54:27 -0800 2017","Sun Feb 12 13:28:05 -0800 2017",0,0

 Part 1, Scout is small and not yet fully aware of appropriate social behavior; together with her brother Jem, they often get into trouble and/or do things which their father, a very well read, well educated lawyer would have disapproved of. 
 Part 2, People and context appear from a new perspective, because while only 2 years passed from the beginning of the novel, Scout and Jem grew ""old"" intellectually and learned valuable lessons for life. 
 The two main sub-stories: 
 Sub-story 1: To kill a mockingbird - Tom Robinson, a colored man who was accused to have raped a white woman, although he was clearly innocent (physical evidence and a compelling story) is nevertheless convicted and later on killed as he tempted scape. 
 Sub-story 2: Not to kill a mockingbird - Boo Radley, whom most of Maycomb's inhabitants believed was a insane and evil guy, was in the end recognized to be a nice guy who besides having given Scout and Jem gifts earlier in the novel, saved them from Ewell's murder attempt.

The Finches are a captivating family and Scout and Jem's adventure's are a delight to follow. Scout and her childish innocence and her rebellious ways made everything even better, waving through themes like prejudice and justice easily and in a understable and relatable way.

My English teacher decided it would be a good idea to make us read no more than 4 chapters at a time and discuss them, which was, in fact, not a good idea. We ended up discussing the same things over and over again with no fresh ideas. 
 Nonetheless, I read said 4 chapters the night before every single time the due date was creeping up. I wish I would have had a week to read this book, because it honestly took me about 10 minutes to read 30 pages of it. I could have had this finished in one night. But when you have my English teacher, you can't have your way. 
 ANYWAY. The point is, I looooove To Kill a Mockingbird. I don't usually read books like this. I'm not a fan of the classics or historical fiction or anything like that. I didn't even finish Great Expectations when I had to read it. I have read some books for history, but I didn't enjoy any as much as this one. 
 Because I actually loved it. 
 I loved the setting and the lessons and the characters and everything about this wonderful story. 
 Scout I obviously adored. Since she is retelling the story as a grown woman, she has the knowledge of a lady, but her younger self's account of the story still has the youthful view. Scout's tomboy nature, her adorable interactions with Atticus, and her cute relationship with Dill were so endearing that I couldn't help but fall in love with her right away. 
 ""Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing."" 
 Jem may have went through some phases where he was moody or mean, and he may think he is better than Scout sometimes, but in the end, he grew into someone Scout knew she could always look to. No matter how the siblings change individually, they will never grow apart from each other. As Scout becomes a lady and Jem becomes a man, they will grow together, and these changes may even bring them closer. 
 ""Jem was becoming almost as good as Atticus at making you feel right when things went wrong."" 
 ""If there's just one kind of folks, why can't they get along with each other? If they're all alike, why do they go out of their way to despise each other? Scout, I think I'm beginning to understand something. I think I'm beginning to understand why Boo Radley's stayed shut up in the house all this time. It's because he wants to stay inside."" 
 Jem's reaction to Tom Robinson's trial was really eye-opening since he recognized how unjust the verdict was. He knew that the case was primarily based on race, and he expressed how wrong he believed that was. 
 Atticus was the ultimate father figure. The lessons he taught Jem and Scout are lessons that even I could do to learn. He was not just a hero to his children but also to the entire black community of Maycomb county. He was a white man who defended Tom Robinson, and that was more than any whites had done for them before. (view spoiler)[Even though Tom lost the case, Atticus's willingness to defend him was a small victory for the community. When he walked out of the courtroom, the black community stood up out of respect for the man who had poured everything he had into defending a man who, according to social prejudices, he should have looked down upon. But he didn't. Atticus told his children that he does his best to love everybody. (hide spoiler)] He taught the entire courtroom a lesson in acceptance and gave his children lessons that they would carry with them through their lives. 
 ""It was times like these when I thought my father, who hated guns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who ever lived."" 
 ""'Before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.'"" 
 ""'You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view. . . . Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.'"" 
 ""Real courage is when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what."" 
 Miss Maudie served as one of the mother figures to Jem and Scout. She baked cakes, gardened, and always looked on the bright side. She was the one who gave the children insight as to why Atticus was forced to do the ""dirty work"" of Maycomb County. She knew that Atticus being appointed to Tom Robinson's case was not a mistake on Judge Taylor's part: it was an effort to prove Tom Robinson's innocence. 
 ""People in their right minds never take pride in their talents."" 
 ""Mockingbirds don't do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corn cribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."" 
 I even loved Tom Robinson. I didn't see much of him, but at the times that I did, he came across as a very honest, kind man. There is no world in which I can see him committing the terrible crime he was accused of. This man had a wife, children, a job. As a black man, doing anything against a white would mean putting his entire livelihood on the line, and with the life he was blessed with, there was no way Tom would risk it. His fate was a terrible one, but his experiences go to show the utterly horrible racism present in America back then, and people who read of Tom will hopefully realize their own prejudices. 
 I thought that Dill would be a bigger character than he ended up being, but in a way, he was one of the biggest characters. According to Jem, he was the one who started the journey toward Jem's ""accident."" He was the one who introduced the idea of getting Boo Radley to come out, and this led to more. 
 Everything affects everything. 
 The Ewells . . . Those jerks. They are one of the reasons To Kill a Mockingbird is such a controversial book. Mayella Ewell accuses Tom Robinson of one of the worst crimes possible, and the fact that he is innocent of the crime but is still found guilty is what makes this so awful. Bob Ewell is a disgusting human being. (view spoiler)[Bob is too cowardly to go after Atticus after the trial, so he decides to target Atticus's young children in a place where they feel safe: near their home. They were vulnerable, and he attacked them. Thank God Scout had on her chicken costume and Boo came out and served as the real MVP or there would have been some serious consequences. (hide spoiler)] 
 Boo. Radley. Boo Radley. BOO RADLEY. BOOOOO RADLEEEYYYYY!!!!! I actually cried when we finally met Boo Radley. (view spoiler)[The entire book built up to Boo Radley's reveal. It was Scout's reaction to seeing Boo that finally drove me to tears. When she realizes who he is, she tears up. After the years of anticipation, she finally meets the very bane of her existence as a child. She was no longer afraid of the man who had been the fuel of her nightmares when she was young. She quickly accepted Boo Radley as a friend, led him through her house, and even made it look like he was leading her somewhere so that he would seem to be a gentleman. Scout's views of Boo Radley are one of the main guidelines as to how she grew up. When she realizes that Boo Radley is no longer a fear of hers, this is because her new fears are much more present. She is terrified of Bob Ewell hurting her father now, and Boo Radley does not seem as scary as he used to. Jem and Scout have been hardened by the events during and after the trial, and Boo Radley has become nothing more than an object of fascination. BUT when he saves Jem, he becomes a fast friend. (hide spoiler)] 
 He helps Scout learn one of the most valuble lessons of the whole novel: you can't understand a person until you stand in their shoes. She takes a lot of time to see the neighborhood from Boo Radley's perspective and she learns that that is the only way to know a person's intentions and emotions. 
 AH I JUST LOVE BOO RADLEY. 
 Plus he's played by Robert Duvall in the movie, and who doesn't love a little RobDu? 
 Oh, Aunt Alexandra. I've got to say, I really hated you at first. When you first came to Finch house, you tried to take over, and I thought Atticus was doing just fine. She really did want the best for Jem and Scout, but she went about getting that for them in the wrong ways. Buuuutttt in the end, like a lot of characters, I developed a soft spot for you and decided I liked you a little bit. A lot. I liked you a lot. 
 And Calpurnia. Who could forget Calpurnia? Yet another one of the mother figures for Jem and Scout, she always seemed to favor Jem, but she definitely loved both of the children. Calpurnia looked out for the Finch kids like they were her own. 
 Other characters, such as the Cunninghams, Cecil Jacobs, Link Deas, Mr Underwood, Helen Robinson, Judge Taylor, and Reverend Sykes should be mentioned but to be honest, I just don't feel like writing any longer. 
 So basically everyone in the world should read this book and gain a ton of knowledge from it. The lessons taught in To Kill a Mockingbird should be learned and remembered by all. I know this book has been banned many times and is extremely controversial, but I think that despite the dispute surrounding it, To Kill a Mockingbird accurately depicts one of the terrors of US history. Just because we are ashamed of our past does not mean it shouldn't be known, and this novel is one of the best ways to learn. It is told through the eyes of a child uncovering the secrets of her town and those who reside within it. If you don't read this book, you are missing out on a vital part of life. We learn from our history, even the parts that are horrific. 
 If you have ever been interested in reading this book, do it. If you don't, I assure you that you will regret it. You can probably finish it in less than 2 days. 
 You can definitely finish it in less than 2 days. Because you'll really love it. I promise.

 Rather than analyse such a classic book I just want to talk about some of my favourite things. 
 I have to applaud an author who is able to write a book in which an eight year old narrates a story that heavily involves a court case in which a black man is accused of rape. Her youth and her lack of a mother possibly make her the least informed person in the entire town. I can see how using this child really allows the author absolute control over the release of information. It is clear that the crime and the trial are the subject of endless town gossip, but as a reader we are kept in the dark until the author is ready to share the information, due to the narrator simply not being privvy to the gossip of town. 
 I like the fallibility of the father. Mr Finch really is the hero of the book. The narrator is telling us the story of her father. It seems rare to give the main character subtle character flaws (make them big or not at all). It is a small thing but I appreciate how naive he is to the danger he faces from both the mob of men (prior to the trial) and Mr Ewell (after the trial).","Fri Jun 18 06:59:47 -0700 2010","Mon Jul 04 17:13:29 -0700 2011","Sun Mar 06 00:00:00 -0800 2011","",1,0

 The first half of the book is mainly about Scout & Jem & just their general life around town & the adventures they get up to. I went into this book thinking that it was mostly about Atticus & the trial he was involved with - as this is what's spoken about the most when people mention this book. 
 It's very well written & gives the reader a wonderful, yet troubling insight into American life in the 1930's. I can understand why this book is taught in school's - it deals with class, rape & racial injustice. 
 Atticus Finch is known throughout the literary world as being a hero, and I agree with this statement. However I wished the author could have gone into more detail after the trial in relation to Atticus & his thoughts/feelings. I know this may not have been possible given the narration, & because of this he comes across as very one-dimensional. 
 In my opinion, Atticus wasn't that great of a father. He seemed dismissive of his kids, hardly spent any time with them & pretty much just let them do whatever they wanted. I felt no connection between him & the children, & aside from a few 'pearls of wisdom' he really didn't say that much to them. Perhaps this was just the way it was in the 1930's. 
 I completely understand why this book won a Pulitzer Prize, however in the end, I really just didn't connect with the story or any of the characters in the book.","Sun Jun 14 19:34:19 -0700 2015","Mon Nov 30 00:28:10 -0800 2015","Wed Jun 17 00:00:00 -0700 2015","Sun Jun 14 00:00:00 -0700 2015",1,0

I had read it years ago when i was maybe fifteen and i only remembered it in bits and pieces. So when I saw a readalong on Goodreads and with the sad passing away of the author i was only too eager to read it again. There is a world of a difference when you read a book at fifteen and at twenty-five. As a teenager i remember that i liked the book, identified with the simply and innocently portrayed children's games and their motivations for their torment of Boo Radley. I understood the theme of the book, the fight for justice and the desmystification of Arthur (Boo) Radley. But i did not understand the finer nuances of the writing. I did not appreciate the genius of a story so simply and effectively told, which dealt with a very complex and age-old problem of racism in Southern America. 
 Recently i read the Bregden Chronicles by Virginia Gaffney. It is an eight book series, focussed on the Civil War and the life and struggles of a plantation owners only daughter, Carrie Cromwell who fights against racism in the Southern state of Virginia, at a time when blacks were simply considered to be sub-human. I really loved the series, but coming back to the point, reading it gave me a deeper insight into the racial issues in America at that time. To Kill A mockingbird is set about a century later but the conditions for blacks show slight improvement. Scout and Jem Finch are the exceptions to the rule in the small fictional town of Maycomb. Exceptions because they have been taught to follow their conscience by their father Atticus Finch. He is man with absolutely no prejudice and great courage. He knows that by following his conscience his and his family's very life could be in danger. Yet he knows he cannot teach his children anything if he does not himself set and example for what is right. In every area of life, he has been an upstanding and respectable but more importantly conscientious citizen of Maycomb. He has taught his children respect and equality and always told them the truth about any matter. If the world had more people like Atticus Finch, it would be a better place. 
 The story is told in the voice of the young Scout Finch, who is courageous curious and hilarious. In the innocent narration of a child's voice it is much easier to understand simple truths and observations of the world around them. Scout takes things matter of factly and through her we can understand her neighbors, father, Aunt, Jem and Dill in a few sentences. Scout adores and respects her father above all others and her puzzlement at his defense of a black man when the whole town shows that children are but impressionable. It's what you teach your child by setting an example, not mere words that shapes their characters. The book has many layers, racial prejudice of a town set in its ways, where everyone has typical manners and families are identified by particular 'streaks.' The courage of one man against his friends and neighbors. The moral struggle of town faced with a dilemma. The vice like grip of small town prejudices. The importance of being conscientious rather than religious. The ever present struggle for changing mindsets and giving everyone a chance. Tom Robinson is convicted inspite of his innocence being proved in court because he is black. Arthur Radley is made into an evil monster and not even given a chance to lead a normal life. To Kill A Mockingbird is a timeless classic, that needs to be read by everyone who hasn't read it irrespective of age, gender and location. It is a lesson in morality and goodness. Though the main theme is racial prejudice it also teaches us humanity and conscientiousness for all situations in life. I'm sharing some of my favourite quotes from the book. I'll forgo the famous 'its a sin to kill a Mockingbird' for fear of being archetypal, but share some of my other favorites. 
 But sometimes a Bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand of another.. 
 There are just some kind of men who're so busy worrying about the next world they've never learned to live in this one. 
 I never understood her preoccupation with heredity. Somewhere, I had received the impression that Fine Folks were people who did the best they could with the sense they had, but aunt Alexandra was of the opinion, obliquely expressed, that the longer a family had been squatting one patch of land the finer it was. 
 I'm no idealist to believe firmly in the integrity of ur courts and in the jury system - that is no ideal to me, it is a living, working reality. Gentlemen, a court is no better than each man of you sitting before me on this jury. a court is only as sound as its jury and the jury is only as sound as the men who make it up. 
 These are just a few of the many effective and thought provoking statements in the book. Harper Lee has written a lesson in moral living in a witty, ironic, humourous and gripping tale of humanity and justice. 
 Needless to say the book gets 5/5 and a shelved under a Must Read for everyone.","Sun Mar 20 04:03:14 -0700 2016","Sun Mar 20 04:03:44 -0700 2016","Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 2016","Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 2016",0,0

 I enjoy the heavy-handed illustrations of prejudice; that was the theme that hooked me the first time. Now on the reread, I was able to look at it beyond that. I could focus more on the small-town dynamics which is a concept Go Set a Watchman delves into. Whereas on my first read, I took to Scout, now I found myself appreciating Jem's role more fully. 
 One of the quotes I latched onto this time was one that I didn't understand at first. I reread the section several times but I still couldn't place the tone or implication well enough until I looked it up. This quote takes place during one of Aunt Alexandra's gatherings, as the ladies are discussing the trial: ""His food doesn't stick going down does it"" I couldn't tell who ""he"" was at first, but after realizing it was Atticus, I loved the witty defense of the Finch family by Miss Maudie. It became yet another example of how Maycombe residents are all linked to one another below the surface; Mrs. Merriweather does not comprehend how hypocritical her disapproval of Atticus' involvement in the trial is, while she is a guest at his house. No matter how different the town's families are, nobody exists in complete isolation. People and ideas have influence beyond those directly involved. 
 I realize that I just read Watchman within the last 2 years, but now I feel the need to go back and read it again. I tried to see this book through the eyes of adult Scout and more cynical Atticus, but I think it needed to be more recent to make direct comparisons.","Tue Jan 20 18:06:46 -0800 2015","Sun Apr 02 20:44:05 -0700 2017","Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 -0700 2017","Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 -0800 2017",2,0

 Look close enough though, beneath the lessons of racism and prejudice, and the development of conscience, and Harper Lee's first and only novel is essentially Scout's reflection on just who or what started the series of events that led to her brother Jem breaking his arm. The phrase 'long story short' need not apply here. 
 The famous court case is the natural centerpiece, full of drama and intensity, but I appreciated every scene for what it brought to the overall message. The case is just as significant to the loss of childhood innocence as the death of a cantankerous neighbor, hypocrisy from a teacher, humanization of a shadowy figure, or revelation of a parent's hidden skills. 
 In this way, summer friend Dill's blatant lies about his family structure are as bad as the conviction of a guiltless man. Childish name-calling as ignorant as senseless killing. Each incident, whether juvenile or adult, is leveled by Scout's youthfully curious gaze. 
 It is easy to be swept up in Scout's day-to-day existence in Maycomb, Gothic elements, deft, spooky suspense, and taut courtroom interrogation heightening some moments above the rest. 
 The parts that stick out to me are those that moved me most: Atticus in the middle of the road, forsaking his glasses to the ground for the rifle in his expert hands; Jem and Scout walking home on Halloween and the aftermath that follows; cement in a healthy tree; Atticus' final appeal to the jury; Scout standing in someone else's shoes. 
 I marveled at the bravery in Atticus' imperfections, his steely commitment to do what was right--in the court of law as in his household--even if it was a lost cause. I found myself very envious of Scout for both her patient, honest father and protective brother, if not also her tomboy gumption that often dissipates in girls along with childhood. 
 The only thing I disliked about To Kill a Mockingbird was that Scout ever ceased her narration. The best stories always have more life in them than the author reveals on the page. Of course the novel needed to end where it did, for the story had come full circle. Once Jem's arm broke at the elbow, it's up to the reader to decide for themselves just who or what started it all.","Tue Jul 06 19:46:42 -0700 2010","Sat Jul 02 18:22:53 -0700 2011","Thu Jun 30 00:00:00 -0700 2011","Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 -0700 2011",1,1

 If the book were written today, it would probably be a very different book. There would probably be stronger black characters - Tom Robinson and Calpurnia, though important in the book, are still minor characters. But for its time (1961), this book was really revolutionary, declaring through Atticus that ""all men are created equal."" During a period when black men could still be executed for raping white women, when black men still lived in fear of being lynched, when the Civil Rights movement was beginning to be underway, this was a startling book for a white woman to write. And it still resonates today. 
 There are many undercurrents in the book - Jem's sense of justice, Atticus's nobility, Tom Robinson's courage in the face of a certain verdict. The child's perspective shows us the toll that racism and injustice can have, and why people must fight for what is right.

To me it felt like it dragged on and could have used some cutting down, but some people like to hear about life in the 1930's. When I did eventually get to chapter 11, I did start to enjoy the book a lot more and finally at chapter 17 we started to get into the real story of To Kill A Mockingbird; The Court Case. 
 Atticus was the only truly enjoyable character for me. He was a wise and fair man, though he never wanted to take Tom Robinson case he did his upmost to make sure he was treated fairly and got the best representation possible. Atticus was the shining light throughout this book; he was a scholar and gentlemen through thick and thin. Once the court case was over and Atticus no longer had to deal with Tim Robinson the book again went back to its original slow pace and eventually fizzled out. 
 The book wasn't all bad, it was well written and tackled some important topics, including racial injustice, class and even sexuality. I can see why this is a classic book and I think Harper Lee did a fantastic job at shedding light on some important social issues, the story just felt to slow for my liking, but I can understand why so many people enjoy this book.","Fri Jul 16 08:57:57 -0700 2010","Tue Jul 27 16:56:34 -0700 2010","Sat Jul 24 00:00:00 -0700 2010","Sun Jul 18 00:00:00 -0700 2010",3,0

I decided to pick it up when all the buzz started going about Harper Lee's second book. I was both saddened and surprised by how relevant this book written in 1960 felt today. Choosing to use Scout (Jean Louise) the youngest character in the book to tell a story about this small town and its very ugly racism and her coming to grips with what it means to be racist was a compelling approach and I think it dissected feeling and thoughts I've had about racism in my life. I liked Scout sometimes, know-it-all characters are seldom my cup of tea, especially when they don't know, but watching her learn what she thought she knew was enthralling. Atticus was too perfect a human being to the point where I really just said, ""Come on."" But I believe the character is more of a symbol that a real person. Yes in the book he was Scout's father, but to me he represented what we all strive or should strive to be when we interact with fellow humans, but very often fail to do. The state the country is in now and has always been is a chaos of White vs Black, Rich vs Poor, etc, etc. This idea of respect and compassion is a message that everyone seems to be missing. We all think we are the fair minded ones and that everyone else is crazy or misinformed and we never stop to wonder why they feel the way they do. Why they disagree to vehemently with us. We argue for our perspective and seldom hear the other side. I though this book was fantastic and I'm sorry I only read it for the first time now, but I'm glad I did. 
 After finishing this book I read a synopsis of the new one and I have concluded that the book was very clearly a first draft and does plenty to tarnish everything ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" established.

In the beginning I wasn't sure I understand where all this is going - why should I care about these kids, their childish adventures? The storytelling manner was also quite childish. That's understandable, of course, because it's told from the point of view of a 6-7 year old kiddo. 
 Closer to the middle of the story I finally started getting where all this is going and what's it all about. I think it's a very rare combination when a story narrated by a child is actually a story for grown-ups discussing such serious problems as discrimination by race and general injustice, violence, rape. 
 But I actually enjoyed the second theme of the story even more. To Kill a Mockingbird shows us that children are, unfortunately, mostly the only ones in the world who can really tell the difference between good and bad, who are capable of empathy and real emotions. This is what makes this story popular nowadays - people grow up and become indifferent to all that is sad, evil and horrible out there. They build a wall around themselves and spend their lives convincing themselves that they don't care. Children never do it. I think every single person should bring these traits with them into their adult life. And I don't understand why it doesn't happen. 
 Another thing. Atticus is one of the best father figures in literature for me now. Honestly, he's the embodiment of a perfect father: strict, but caring, he is able to balance these traits. He's wise, he has high moral standards and rules, which he follows and therefore sets an example for his children. I am very very fond of him. 
 All in all, it's unquestionable why this book is a world classic and still being read in the 21st century. People will read and relate to it until they learn to be... to be better than they are, I guess. :-)","Sun Aug 26 07:32:04 -0700 2012","Tue Oct 02 12:14:11 -0700 2012","Tue Oct 02 12:14:11 -0700 2012","Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 -0700 2012",2,0

This is such a great classic because it also teaches people how to be tolerant of those who differ from us. If Scout can be kind to those who are unlike herself, than why can't we all? A great book to be read again and again, To Kill a Mockingbird is a great story of tolerance, truth and friendship. <3","Sun Aug 15 15:35:26 -0700 2010","Sun Aug 15 15:43:24 -0700 2010","","",0,0

The previous rating (4 stars) was accurate as to my having read it many years ago. I still would continue to rate it as that. But maybe a slightly ""different"" 4 stars. This was when I set it at 4 stars, to be a ""not quite 5 stars"" and this now is a ""more than 3 stars""... 
 I had started reading this a while ago. I had been having a lot of trouble reading it. I got about 1/3 of the way through over a period of about 3 weeks of trying to read it. I wasn't feeling up to re-reading that part after having picked it up again a couple of months after having put it down (taken it back to the library). So I tried to remember where I had read to. 
 This time I started reading about chapter 10 of the book, which as best I can tell was where I had read to. And I immediately felt that I was reading a good book, that was going places that I really was hoping it was going. 
 Having read it a long time ago, I had remembered good parts of the plot. And even good parts of how the characters developed. The thing about this is... I read it now, being able to remember those things, but still enjoying it. 
 Other books I have tried to re-read only to find I just couldn't stand re-reading them. Pretty much all the ""redeeming"" characteristics of those books were really basic elements. The ""basic"" story. And on re-reading, even *that* really made me wonder how I managed to get through the series the first time. 
 Maybe when I was reading months ago, I was feeling a little bit of that. I think like many books, it had flaws, which *largely* fell around the beginning and end of the book. The ""let's introduce what's going on"" and the ""let's make sure we wrap this up nice and neat"" that I find often end up being very difficult for me to get through. 
 The *end* tends to be a little less difficult, because I am more into ""let's actually just finish this"". I may not feel compelled to read it on the basis of the writing, or the plot or really anything about what is going on with the book itself, but having got to the point where they are ""wrapping it all up"" I just feel... ""might as well get this done as quickly as I can even though I'm finding this kind of boring"".

 So you can't go very far in life saying that you love books without people asking you what classics you've read. I don't read classics too often, having tried to pick up Pride and Prejudice and only gotten about 50 pages in. Now, my mom didn't grow up in America, so she never had to read all the American classics my dad did. So, knowing that I was planning to read To Kill A Mockingbird over the summer, she picked it up from the library and read it in July. Or, at least tried to. Because after about 100 pages, she deserted it, claiming that nothing was happening. And that was the end of that. 
 My father, on the other hand, did read this book because he was forced to in class. He remembered hating it, although when I tried to talk to him about the book, he didn't remember any of the actual details to the story. 
 Basically, my family really prefers their YA fantasy and dystopians over classics. 
 For the first part of the book, I was with my parents. Although the writing was good, the storyline was going nowhere, Scout was insufferable and all the characters felt very one dimensional. I'd give the first part of the book two stars. 
 The second part of the book was amazing, though. It was gripping most of the way through, layered with metaphors and philosophy and made me feel towards the characters. The second part is really what most people think of when TKAM is mentioned because that's where the main part of the story occurs. That part alone is probably somewhere between 4.5 and 5 stars. 
 Now, my problem with this book is that a lot of the first part just feels very irrelevant to the story, and that's what makes it so dry in the beginning. Although the book is actually about Scout and Jem growing up in Maycomb, there are some details that honestly have no purpose in the story. It would've been nice if Lee had cut out some of the parts that didn't pertain to the main two stories: the court case and Boo Radley. 
 The only other real problem I had with this book was that the characters all felt very one dimensional. Scout was the innocent smart child, Jem was the annoying but wiser older brother, Atticus was the wise, politically correct father, Cal was the sweet maid, Alexandra was the typical Southern belle, Dill was just an annoying kid, Boo was the kind town recluse, Tom was an innocent hardworking man, and Bob Ewell was just the town drunk trying to make some money. 
 In the first part of TKAM, the main story is about Scout, Jem and Dill trying to catch a glimpse of the town recluse, Boo Radley. They have multiple schemes about trying to get him to come out mixed in with their everyday escapades. Again, this part is very slow, and not a lot happens, so I can't say I enjoyed it too much. 
 If you haven't read this book, I will warn you, there is racism present. If that is something that makes you uncomfortable and you try to stay away from it, I would advise you not read this book. The court case in the story is that Scout and Jem's father, Atticus, is defending a black man named Tom Robinson who was accused of raping a white girl. Lee handles this topic with grace, and even gives Scout lines where she points out the double standard about discrimination throughout the world. I did find the court case very interesting, not only in how Atticus handled everything, but in how well he was able to sense what really happened. 
 During the first half of the first part, I really liked Scout. She was smart and didn't mix her opinion in with things she saw. That's really why Lee chose Scout as the narrator, because she told everything exactly how she saw it, without trying to mix what she thought up with what actually happened. When dealing with such sensitive topics, the narrator should only be saying the facts. I didn't really understand her whole thing with Dill, how she actually thought that they were going to get married. I wanted to slap her every time she talked about her 'fiance'. ""...Summer was the swiftness with which Dill would reach up and kiss me when Jem was not looking, the longings we sometimes felt each other feel. With him, life was routine; without him, life was unbearable."" Please *eye roll*. She got better as the book went on, but I didn't feel a ton of character development with her. Scout became less violent for sure, and a bit more ladylike, but that's not really development. Her character felt very dry and needed more substance to her. 
 I'm not going to do my usual character analysis with spoilers just because I feel like there wasn't enough substance to the characters or character development to do it. 
 So this book was good, but it wasn't as good as it was hyped up to be. The characters were flat and the first part seemed to drag on forever. But the writing style was still very good with a lot of interesting twists in the story in the second part. Read it, and please tell me if you agreed with my thoughts or if you felt differently. 
 Thanks for reading,

 The typical synopsis of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" states that it takes place in Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930s. Told from the point of view of Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch as an adult, it follows the story of Scout, her older brother Jem, and their father Atticus. Atticus is a defense attorney, and is assigned to the case of Tom Robinson, who has been falsely accused of raping a white woman. 
 This story, however, is so much more than that. It has so many important themes: particularly racism, socioeconomic prejudice, and, perhaps most importantly, childhood and the subsequent loss of childhood. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is truly the story of Jem: a young boy who grows up in an area full of racism, whose childhood beliefs about the goodness of his town and its residents are demolished by a 'simple' court decision. What makes this character development interestingly spectacular and heart-wrenching is the fact that the novel isn't even told from Jem's point of view, but rather from his younger sister's. 
 I could literally write papers and essays about how life-changing and thought-provoking this novel is (and I have done just that); however, no words could truthfully capture my love for ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""

Sure, I'd been through those 500 page Star Wars & Forgotten Realms books before, among other things, but this was literature. I didn't enjoy it for the first third or so, but then I felt in the groove, & by the end, of course, Atticus had changed my life forevermore. A friend drunkenly shoplifted me the book a couple of years later, & I've been intending to re-read it ever since, so I'm almost sad it's taken this long. After reading the 'sequel' earlier this year, however, I knew it was high time. I am so happy that circumstance finally led to this. 
 Re-reading this book made me realize a few things. For instance: I love it, & it means more to me than most books. I connect with it. Hemingway may be a kingly author, & The Sun Also Rises may be a better book (&, indeed, is one of my favourites), but I think I like this better. My favourite books are often crazy philosophical trips, with meta-leanings. Those are my favourites. & also, there are books I like greatly due to personality - Kerouac (in fact, all the Beats), Bukowski, HST, etc... but then, there is 'plain' literature. It surprises me to find, upon digging within myself, that I think my favourite books of 'plain' literature are Grapes of Wrath, Mockingbird, & Salinger's works. They trump the Great Gatsbys & the Sun Also Rises(es) to me. (Interesting also, I guess, that Mockingbird & Grapes both fit fairly snugly into a humble kind of realm, while Salinger - though being anti-intellectual in his own way - often radiates a self-aware intellectualism, differentiating his works rather dramatically.) 
 Anyway, recollections & realizations aside, this book is just great. It has everything. It has one of the greatest characters in literature, just about an archetype of morality & justice. It has suspense, sentimentality, humour, wit, charm, development, religion, sadness, friendship, family, history, & everything else. Scout's perspective is just so wonderful - it does any adult well to learn from children, but Scout makes it so easy & enjoyable. 
 Honestly, besides rather enjoying it, I remember little about Go Set A Watchman. I remember thinking it may have been possible for Atticus to become that person, but knowing I had to re-read Mockingbird to be sure. Reading this now, I just want to re-read Watchman, as I feel like I remember none of it - as if it was all too new, & that I would understand it more with this adult reading of Mockingbird in my mind.

 Well, this drags on, but I plan on re-reading this every year or two for the foreseeable future, so will update it as thoughts come to me.","Sat Aug 21 23:32:19 -0700 2010","Wed Dec 30 10:36:04 -0800 2015","Wed Dec 30 10:36:04 -0800 2015","",0,0

So I decided I wanted to see for myself what the fuss was all about and let me tell you, I fell in love. 
 To Kill a Mockingbird starts rather innocent, narrated by a little girl, Scout, with a sophisticated father and a smart brother. She herself of course is witty and educated, but still way too young to understand the dark and confusing things that are going on in the little town called Maycomb, that of course become very obvious to the reader. It is a rather interesting concept to have the protagonist understand much less of the situation than the reader itself, but I think Harper Lee had this well thought through because it gave her the opportunity to write about very difficult and sometimes taboo topics without commenting on them herself or seeming biased, since Scout herself doesn't really have an opinion on these things. 
 I think Harper Lee did a brilliant job creating, nurturing and growing these characters. That is why the beginning of the book may seem a little long and boring, since nothing really happens but the kids playing and enjoying summer, going to school and fighting. I liked this part a lot since it seems Harper Lee took her time to let the characters and their personas sink into the readers brain and create an image of them and their surroundings that lasted. 
 The author deals with a very delicate subject that is still relevant today: racism and discrimination towards certain groups of people. It is all the more interesting that she does it from the view of a little girl, since she lets her ask questions that may seem silly to us but are so on point that they leave us sitting in confusion asking ourselves: ""Yes, why is that so? Why do we do this? Just because it has 'always' been done?"" 
 It reminded me of the story with the naked emperor that gets called out by a little boy and makes everyone realise how silly and irrational they have been behaving and leaving them thinking: ""Why don't we questions daily rituals just because they 'have always been done that way'?"" 
 I also very much enjoyed the way Harper Lee writes her ""villains"". I can't even quite call them villains because not even she does. Every character in her book has a good and a bad side. There is no black and white distinction. Literally. She introduces us to a character that infuriates us in his/her ways but then throws reasons at us as to why this character has been behaving the way he/she has and leaves us with a slight feeling of guilt since we hastily started to despise the character without thinking twice about the reasons behind his/her ways. 
 I do absolutely understand what all the fuss is about and I absolutely recommend everyone to read this book, whether it is to enlighten oneself or strengthen his beliefs and views. Her writing style is quirky and funny, but never leaves out the important and serious topics and issues. I am truly amazed by this book. 
 Thank you, Harper Lee. 
 Ps.: As always, excuse my english, it's not my mother tongue, so I apologize for any confusing sentences or words I may have used. I am still learning. Thank you for reading.","Sun Jun 07 05:33:40 -0700 2015","Sun Jan 10 23:05:12 -0800 2016","Sat May 23 00:00:00 -0700 2015","",0,0

This makes the story all that much better- and sadder. 
 I enjoyed the morals taught by lovable and decent father Atticus, as well as the lessons learned by Jem and Scout. Invaluable knowledge could be gleaned from such a wise and morally decent man. 
 I found it of particular interest, the way that the character, Boo Radley, was cleverly woven into the story. The end left of the book admittedly left me feeling a little bit, ""eh,"" that being said, the journey to get there was a good one. 
 The story was most definitely painful at times... but filled with hope. The hope that, there are some good people, such as Atticus, who will be strong enough to do right, when not many others are willing, even if they recognize it to be the decent thing to do. However, the story also showed the true colors and darkness of some... such as Mr. Ewell.

I recall enjoying the book as an adolescent, but I think at that time I was reading more for meaning than the pleasure of reading (especially since I read it as a school assignment). Now as an adult, a mother, a more mature reader, and as someone who spent a fair chunk of her adult life in the American South, I have a new appreciation for the depth of Lee's genius in this work. 
 The writing is melodious. I luxuriated in the construction of her sentences, which hold layers of intricate meaning. The characters are human; they have complex motivations and make embarrassing gaffes like the rest of us do. Reading this book, I have clear images of Maycomb and its inhabitants. This for me is one of the tests of a ""good book."" I want to feel part of the cast of characters, and I absolutely feel a part of this town. 
 A scene that I had forgotten as a teen but which moved me nearly to tears reading it as an adult was when Scout approaches the crowd outside the jail. With relatively few words, Lee conveys fear, embarrassment, relief, pride, love, anger, and, for me, a sense of the ability of humans to redeem themselves simply by acting human.","Thu Jan 03 08:53:12 -0800 2008","Fri Jun 13 20:28:37 -0700 2008","Thu Jun 12 00:00:00 -0700 2008","",0,0

 This book is something that anyone can relate to, whether you're reading it right now, or fifty years from now. It's more than just black vs white - Maycomb is like a mini version world: It's where people will always look down on others, it's where some people will take advantage of others, it's where the bad guys seem louder than the good guys. And then there are a small minority who always make you appreciate human beings (especially kids). 
 People are people - despite what they do, they're still human beings that end up being your neighbors, your friends, the people you grew up with. They do what they do, you might not like what they do, but you still care about them.","Fri May 08 16:42:33 -0700 2015","Sun Dec 20 14:44:52 -0800 2015","Thu Dec 03 00:00:00 -0800 2015","Tue Dec 01 00:00:00 -0800 2015",0,0

It is not easy for me to like a book from the first few chapters but that is what it was like reading it. I think what I admired the most is how Atticus treats his two children, the way he deals with the mishappenings and wrongdoings, the way he approaches their problems and questions. He simply gave them their freedom to explore and experience without resistance to what they do or pressure to be or do something they do not want. He gave them the freedom of thought. His ideas about parenthood are pure gold.

 Harper Lee introduces us to Scout, the young, precocious narrator of her novel who is probably one of the best characters written. Through Scout's eyes, alongside her brother Jem and cohort Dill, we gain a picture of growing up in a small town in 1930's Alabama. At the heart of the book is the trial of a black man accused of raping a white girl. The whole of the book reveals the weight these children face as adults divide themselves along lines of color, class and status. Thanks belong to a child's resilient nature and to their father Atticus, who quietly by example teaches them, and the reader, to see through eyes without prejudice. And I can't forget one Boo Radley. 
 Scout made me laugh throughout the entire book. Lee wrote her heroine's character with a child's innocence, an off-the-wall humor, and wisdom beyond her years. I thought the story was solid from beginning to end. Sometimes I could predict the outcome, but that took nothing away from my feelings for the story at the end. 
 I don't know if Harper Lee wrote the perfect book. I do believe that she tackled subjects that need to be read. Although the face of things may have changed over time, racism and prejudice still exist. If there's one thing people can do to change this, it is to write a story like Lee did. The book may be fiction, but there is so much truth inside its covers. 
 I've heard that Go Set a Watchman changes the way we see Atticus. I'm just happy that I'll at least get to read another book by Harper Lee. I'm sure if she had continued to write, all her books would have been compared to her first, but I wish there were more out there.","Tue Jul 14 09:10:51 -0700 2015","Sat Dec 12 11:43:50 -0800 2015","Tue Aug 18 00:00:00 -0700 2015","Sat Aug 15 00:00:00 -0700 2015",30,7

 What is this book about? 
 The story takes place in a sleepy Southern Town in the 1930's during the Great Depression. People were poor and social equality was still a long way off. We follow Scout, her brother Jem and father Atticus through a court case that changes the lives of everyone living in Maycomb. During this case we tackle racism, religion, the coming-of-age of Scout, parenthood, love, death and every other aspect of life you can think off. 
 Why is it boring? 
 I guess it is kind of a legal drama... Not that those are boring and not that To Kill a Mockingbird is boring, but it's about the only fault I can come up with. This book would do well on job interviews. It's only fault is that it might just be a little bit too perfect. 
 Who would you recommend it to? 
 Everyone. This book is amazing at giving you perspective, at considering things from other people's point of view and imagining other people complexly. I completely understand that this book is required reading in most American schools and I don't understand why I haven't been told to read this by my own teachers. To Kill a Mockingbird will teach children and adults alike to think about someone else's circumstances and to not be prejudiced. The book is one long life lesson. If everyone would live according to the 'rules' set in this book, the world would be a much better place. 
 Why should I read it if it's boring?! 
 The prose is amazing, the story is so tight and just insanely emotionally resonating. All the characters in the book are perfect, but flawed in their own way, making them exceptionally human. I love Scout, the young girl who loves to read books and brawl with boys. Her brother Jem is amazing at being an older brother and when he cries about the injustice in the world, all you can do is just cry with him. And then we have Atticus. The most amazing man you will ever read about. I have not read The Road yet, so to me Atticus Finch is hands down the most amazing father in literature. God, there is so much gushing over this book, but it is completely well deserved. Go take a look at the Goodreads page and see how well loved this novel is. Just reading that you can feel how much love there is for the story Harper Lee wrote. What I love most about this book besides the characters, is how Harper Lee never gets preachy. She espouses all of this wisdom and creates near perfect characters that should be perfectly annoying. But she gives every character their own little flaw or strength, making them perfectly human instead. Also, when you finish this book, immediately go back to page 1 and read the first lines. You will be amazed at how well Harper Lee is at telling you a story.

 This is not what you're used to see on this blog. I never review nor rate classic for a simple reason and it's they've been discussed and rated by so many people that my say in all that is irrelevant. But I've made a mistake and put this book into one of my challenges, and I hate leaving things unfinished, so I had to write a review. Make no mistake this is not a review as I won't talk much about this book but I'll talk about my lit classes instead. 
 In case that you don't know I'm a student at faculty (something similar to college) of Philology at English language and literature department. Even though after finishing the studies we more or less become English teachers (as hopefully I will one day) or translators that doesn't stop us from enjoying lit classes. At least it doesn't stop me. I love them for a simple reason and it's that they make me read books that I would never pick my myself nor would I even finish them. But then after discussing them I see the real beauty in them. The same happened with To Kill a Mockingbird. Let's face it, this is by far the most mentioned book in history of American lit and I've tried to read it few years ago and to see what's that all fuss about. I've never finished it as I couldn't understand lots of things. Things, of course, changed after I learnt about American history and discovered everything that happened during that period so now I could easily go through the book. Of course non of that would be possible without my teachers who always try to make them more interesting to us and help us to see real picture. And for that I'm really grateful. 
 Did I enjoy/love/hate this book would be hard to say, but I do see the reason why this is called a classic and why it's so important and that I know how to appreciate.","Tue Oct 26 10:23:16 -0700 2010","Mon Jul 22 23:28:09 -0700 2013","","Sat Jun 04 00:00:00 -0700 2011",6,2

Harper Lee, a rarest of rare lady, has materialized the infinity that is childhood and growing up in the form of this amazing work of art. You feel you are an inherent part of the Finch family right from the first page and see your childhood trammels and tribulations, confusions and playfulness reflected in the everyday activities of the gang of children - Scout, Jem and Dill. 
 Atticus Finch, the lawyer and the father, is one of the greatest heroes I have encountered in English literature and if I personally turn out to be at least half as good as him, I will assume I have turned out to be a fine human being. His words, his lessons to his children and his behavior towards the world - everything is so endearing that you feel like reaching out to him and extend your gratitude for everything.

A neighbor, Dill, joins them in the summers and the trio spend their time outdoors, thinking up ways to lure the mysterious Boo Radley outside. One day, Scout and Jem learn that Atticus, a lawyer, will be representing Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping and assaulting a white woman. Scout and Jem are harassed at school because of this, and their aunt eventually comes to live with them to help keep tomboy Scout out of trouble. Continued under spoilers... (view spoiler)[ The trial comes and goes (in an emotional scene that had me cheering for Atticus and furious at everyone else in the courtroom) and Tom, even though Atticus proves his innocence, is convicted of the crime. 
 Later on, Tom tries to escape jail but is shot and killed. Scout, Jem, and Dill are affected in various ways by the trial and learn important lessons. Slowly, life in Maycomb is returning to normal. However, Bob Ewell, the accuser's father and the one who actually assaulted her, is still furious with Atticus for publicly shaming him. He attacks Scout and Jem on their way home from a Halloween play. Boo Radley rescues the children, though Jem gets a broken arm, and kills Bob Ewell. Scout walks Boo back home after the Sheriff says, ""There's black boy dead for no reason, and the man responsible for it's dead. Let the dead bury the dead this time, Mr. Finch."" Atticus reads a book to Scout until she falls asleep and spends the night watching over Jem. (hide spoiler)] 
 I appreciated the simplicity of the language. It felt like I was reading a story in the hot, humid South. The story flowed perfectly with Lee's writing style; it was straightforward and charming yet never boring. I think the simplicity is what made the message so powerful. 
 I'm just going to assume that people who don't like this book (if you can believe that) were probably forced to read it. I know some also think the characters were a little one-dimensional. I understand that argument, but don't completely buy it. Sure, Atticus was a perfect, can-do-no-wrong father figure, but I don't think it made him unbelievable. He had the weight of the world - or at least Alabama - on his shoulders. He had to hold himself at a high standard, especially for his children. 
 Scout was my favorite, with her tomboy tendencies and polite back-talking. I loved that I could read from the perspective of a child and not want to skim over her thoughts. Once, she referred to waiting as ""two eternities later,"" or something similar, and I laughed out loud. One character I wanted to see more of was Tom. His main appearance was in the courtroom and Atticus' speech on Tom's behalf there broke my heart, so naturally I wasn't satisfied. But because it was Scout's story and she was so young, Tom was only there to be an innocent - a mockingbird. 
 The following are a couple of quotes I most appreciated: 
 ""People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for."" 
 ""Shoot all the Bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em. But remember it's a sin to kill a Mockingbird.""","Fri Aug 21 16:38:59 -0700 2015","Tue Sep 05 12:23:23 -0700 2017","Sat Mar 26 00:00:00 -0700 2016","Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 -0700 2016",6,0

 This is also a part of my 2016 Classics Challenge 
 WHEN I Discovered This Classic 
 I first heard about this book last year in the London Underground where the billboards where advertising Harper Lee's second book - Go Set a Watchman. They had both of her books in one binding and so I became interested in it. Being German I seriously hadn't heard about it before. 
 WHY I Chose to Read It 
 I chose to read it because I was interested in the racial conflicts in the 1960s. Because this book is set in the 1960s (and I knew it contained a serious amount of racism) I was reluctant to read it at first, but then I discovered I would jump right into it, regardless of what the author had to say about the issue. 
 WHAT Makes It A Classic 
 Just like The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer, this book is written from a child's perspective. I am of the opinion that children do often have a different view on things than adults and I was very interested in what a little girl had to say. It is also a classic because this book does not judge. Atticus Finch sees to that. 
 WHAT I Thought of This Classic 
 I loved it. I loved the characters, I loved the way the children were portrayed, the trial itself was very interesting and the fact that Atticus Finch is one of the deepest characters that I have ever read made it so fantastic. 
 WILL It Stay A Classic 
 Yes, indeed. Because of Atticus Finch's personality and morals. 
 WHO I'd Recommend It To 
 Everyone having dealt with racism and those who are not (yet) educated about the racial system in the United States in the 1960s and before that. Shoutout to my fellow Europeans!","Mon Aug 01 05:59:01 -0700 2016","Mon Aug 01 06:07:54 -0700 2016","Thu Jul 07 00:00:00 -0700 2016","",0,0

I also watched the 1962 movie too, starring Gregory Peck, to enhance my understanding of the points the story was making: it covered most of the major plot elements contained in the book, albeit in a slightly different order, emphasising certain aspects of the novel for dramatic effect and leaving others out; it was an interesting comparison. In this brief review I'm not going to run through the plot, rather I'm going to touch on the various themes which I noticed: 
 Good versus Evil 
 ""Mockingbirds don't do one thing but . . . sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."" 
 The exploration of what it means to be good or evil is covered extensively. Mockingbirds (such as Tom Robinson, Boo Radley and possibly even Atticus) are almost entirely good but the characters exhibit and deal with this goodness in different ways, for example Boo hides from evil and Atticus fights it head on. However with Atticus he also understands that good people are weak enough to support an evil cause, for example Mrs. Dubose. Atticus also recognises that we all have a basic level of human dignity which requires respect and an attempt to understand individual points of view, he says: 
 ""You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view--until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."" 
 The novel suggests that failure to ""stand in the other persons shoes"", leads to intolerance and fear which then leads to prejudice and injustice. Once you take the time to understand why a person is behaving in a certain way then tolerance and sympathy will follow which will then ultimately remove prejudice. 
 This lesson in morality suggests that you can live with dignity without becoming overly pessimistic at how others conduct themselves. Scout grasps this when later in the novel she acknowledges Boo for who he is not who she thinks he is; he becomes fully human to Scout, illustrating that she has developed into a sympathetic and understanding individual. Despite the pain Boo has suffered, the purity of his heart guides his dealings with the children; he saves Jem and Scout from Bob Ewell and is the greatest symbol of what it is to be good. 
 Interestingly, the novel doesn't provide clear guidance on how to approach those people who are integrally evil and who are indifferent to reason. That is left up to the reader to consider alone. 
 Groups versus Individuals 
 I mentioned the effect that the irrational grouping of people has in my review of Cats Cradle; while Atticus considers the individual others in the book use religion, race, class, gender or the expected behavioural patterns of society to group people together, set certain standards and norms, create stereotypes and then demand conformity to these; this is sometimes called ""prejudice"" (see above). 
 Perhaps the most powerful example is how most people in the book perceive black people: they are either stupid or evil, both assumptions are skilfully dismissed by the author. For example, even though the black characters are of a lower class than the white Ewells they are more law abiding, accommodating and hard working. 
 Growing Up 
 The children in the book question what doesn't make sense to them, for example the pervasive prejudice and as the novel progresses the children age and slowly lose their innocence: at the start they equate good to mean Atticus and the citizens of Maycomb and evil is personified in the mysterious Boo. As the book concludes their outlook becomes more realistic and they begin to understand the complex nature of morality: everyone is good or evil to a greater or lesser extent. 
 To Kill a Mockingbird also condemns standardized school education: memorisation of facts and figures and the hypocrisy shown when it comes to the discussions about the Nazi party and democracy all highlight how schools create conformist children as opposed to critical thinkers who foster shared understanding across the artificial boundaries mentioned earlier. 
 Courage 
 The theme of courage was perhaps the most powerful for me. Atticus defines courage are follows: 
 ""It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do."" 
 Courage therefore is not the same as power or might, it's about doing what you know is the right thing regardless of what others think (here's an example of this). 
 As: 
 ""The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience."" 
 In conclusion, the skill that has gone into writing this novel is really only understood when you have completed it and thought about the entire story. One the one hand it is a simple morality tale but on the other it really is one of the books that every adult should read before they die.","Sat Jan 17 02:53:59 -0800 2015","Wed Jul 26 08:53:17 -0700 2017","Tue Jan 20 12:58:59 -0800 2015","Sat Jan 17 00:00:00 -0800 2015",0,0

Everything's a little too heavy handed, from its morality to its symbolism to its characterization. Don't get me wrong: this overtness was necessary at a time where many largely white literary readers needed an object lesson in humanity, but the book clearly makes some aesthetic sacrifices to suit its rhetorical purposes. Also, white savior narratives are always problematic, even if this benevolent white savior does ultimately fail. I acknowledge this is a modern view of a classic work, but, I'm only discussing aesthetics here. The dramatic structure's a little wonky too, with chapters serving as their own mini-narrative parables, and the primary conflict not even making itself known until about halfway through the book. A better title might be a Twainesque The Adventures of Scout Finch, providing a clear signal that there's not always much unity among these multiple plots. 
 Still, even beyond TKAM's admirable politics, much of the book does work well. Scout is great narrator, witty and wry and nostalgic about her childhood yet reflective. I think people forget how funny this book is (I certainly did in the years between reading it as a high school student and teaching it as a high school English teacher). Think of the films The Sandlot or A Christmas Story and that's very much the tone here, with an occasional Southern Gothic twist. Also, the author manages a clever narrative device throughout the book where Scout's age sometimes renders her an unreliable narrator in intriguing ways. Not a dishonest narrator but one who, despite how precocious she is, isn't always privy to the world of adults and interprets what's happening around her through the euphemism and evasion of adults in her life. It leads her to moments where she misinterprets situations yet manages to, for example, save her father's life and stop a murderous lynch mob with some ""aw shucks, golly gee whizz"" preciousness. It's fairly similar to those early Harry Potter books/films where those three wizard kids stumble around on investigations based on faulty premises only to inadvertently save their school and its negligent adult educators. 
 All in all, TKAM is a deserving classic even if some its devices feel a bit outdated. I've met people black and white who consider it their favorite book of all time. I'm glad about that; people could do much worse. Its heart is in the right place, and its message about the ethical responsibilities of individuals within unethical societies still matters today. It also reminds us that our conventional wisdom and first impressions of others--not just people of other races but also mysterious recluse neighbors and mean spirited old ladies--are often revealed to be flawed once we have a little more information. As Atticus says during one of his Yoda meets Dumbledore meets Aslan moments, ""You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view [...] until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."" If the book can still teach this, it's still worth reading today.","Sat Jan 08 01:08:27 -0800 2011","Wed Feb 08 03:15:40 -0800 2017","Tue Sep 01 00:00:00 -0700 2009","",4,0

 Harper Lee crafts a novel that conveys ideas of compassion, equality for all, and the injustices of racial discrimination, while not becoming too preachy. She accomplishes this by telling the story from the eyes of an innocent young girl, unaware of the racial tensions around her. In fact, the first part of the story does not deal with Tom Robinson's case or racial issues at all, rather it's about a couple of kids playing together during the summer time, absorbed in the mystery of what has become of Boo Radley. Beginning the story this way allows the reader to become emotionally involved with Scout, and her uncorrupted view of mankind, before leaping into the crux of the novel.The African Americans in To Kill a Mockingbird have been criticized as lacking dimension and I don't disagree with this, however, Scout--being an unreliable narrator and a young white girl--would not have the perspective or the familiarity with black people to give them depth, so I believe Harper Lee could not have rendered them any other way. 
 This book is more than a novel about race; Lee explores the evil in humanity (the use of religion as a way to spew hatred, the hypocrisy of people, peoples tendency to judge others on superficial terms, the failures of the education system), yet at the same time the book is full of love, compassion, and hope. To Kill a Mockingbird is a book about growing up and the lessons that come with it, that should be read by all children coming of age.","Thu Apr 21 20:40:24 -0700 2011","Thu Jun 23 21:18:17 -0700 2011","Mon May 09 00:00:00 -0700 2011","Mon May 02 00:00:00 -0700 2011",1,6

 Boo is the Radley son who has not shown his face outside the creaky old family house for 30 years and more, probably because he has ""shy ways,"" but possibly --an explanation the children much prefer--because his relatives have chained him to his bed. Dill has the notion that Boo might be lured out if a trail of lemon drops were made to lead away from his doorstep. Scout and Jem try a midnight invasion instead, and this stirs up so much commotion that Jem loses his pants skittering back under the fence. 
 Scout and her brother live in Maycomb, Alabama, where every family that amounts to anything has a streak--a peculiar streak, or a morbid streak, or one involving a little ladylike tippling at Lydia Pinkham bottles filled with gin. The Finch family streak is a good deal more serious --it is an overpowering disposition toward sanity. This is the flaw that makes Jem interrupt the boasting of a lineage-proud dowager to ask ""Is this the Cousin Joshua who was locked up for so long?"" And it is what compels Lawyer Atticus Finch, the children's father, to defend a Negro who is charged with raping a white woman. The rape trial, Jem's helling, and even Boo Radley are deeply involved in the irregular and very effective education of Scout Finch. By the time she ends her first-person account at the age of nine, she has learned that people must be judged, but only slowly and thoughtfully. 
 Author Lee, 34, an Alabaman, has written her first novel with all of the tactile brilliance and none of the preciosity generally supposed to be standard swamp-warfare issue for Southern writers. The novel is an account of an awakening to good and evil, and a faint catechistic flavor may have been inevitable.

 I first read this story a little under two years ago. Back then, I did not grasp the full extent of the content Ms Lee developed under the reader's very eyes. Rural Alabama, in the 1930s, populated by a still ever so racist population, one who does not deign to use the words Negro and nigger to describe black people. Rural Alabama, in the 1930s, wherein two white kids witness the stirring of a tranquil town when their lawyer father defends a black man unjustly accused of raping a white young lady. 
 Now, I can at last grasp the meaning of Harper Lee's book, and I wish I could rate this six stars.","Tue Oct 13 08:03:05 -0700 2015","Sun May 15 07:44:23 -0700 2016","Sun May 15 07:44:23 -0700 2016","Sun May 08 00:00:00 -0700 2016",0,0

 Well, in the book Atticus did speak up, but everyone turned against him except for the few who secretly agreed with him. 
 Atticus is probably one of my favorite characters, I loved him because of the good he saw in people and because he tried to raise his children in a world that so desperately tried to teach them how to be superior because of the color of their skin.

 Jean Louise (Scout) Finch is the feistiest girl in Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's. She's six years old and doesn't care to be a lady. She wants to wear pants all her life and mess around with her older brother Jem and their friend, Dill, who visits every summer. To Kill a Mockingbird spans over a couple years of Scout's life, during which she becomes engaged to Dill, attempts to befriend a reclusive neighbor - and, most importantly, witnesses a trial during which a young black man is accused of raping a poor young white girl. These events are seen from the young, questioning eyes of a little girl who wants to understand. It is heart-breaking, eye-opening, and a book that everyone should take the time to devour. 
 _______________________________________________ 
 My thoughts - 
 This is my first time reading To Kill a Mockingbird (people have looked at me, shocked, for saying that), and not only can I say that I've read it, but I can also say that I loved it. 
 I was quite moved by this story. Moved to laughter, moved to sorrow, moved to anger, moved to love. I was inspired by this little girl Jean Louise who saw the world so innocently. I wanted to be like her. I want to be like her. She was precious to read about. 
 Character notes - 
 Scout Finch has a sarcasm that's hard to miss. It adds life to the story and made me laugh. She's one smart little seven-year-old. She understands most things - and when she doesn't she asks questions. Questions that made me think. Questions that seven-year-olds now would never think to ask. Scout is also a deep thinker, pondering the world in that innocent light that she views everything. 
 She loves her family. She has a heart for her brother...wants to do everything to be like him. When he starts to grow up, she doesn't understand it, but she tries her hardest. Because she loves him. 
 And she loves her father, too. Oh boy, their relationship tugged at my heart more than anything else in this story. Atticus Finch is older, has no wife, and would be lonely but for his lovely children. Scout and Jem mean everything him, and he means everything to them, even when they would like to say otherwise. Atticus very easily became my favorite character - for his bravery, his selflessness, his humility, and his desire to do what is right...at all costs. 
 Story notes - 
 This story is well told from the first word to the last. It weaves in family troubles, characters being built, the culture in the south in that time of history, the town's trials and triumphs, strange neighbors, unlikely friends... All of this is seen through the eyes of an observant six/seven/eight year old, and I can't imagine it any other way. It was the perfect touch for the story's progression. 
 Speaking of the progression...it was slow. But not in an ""I'm bored, please get me out of here"" way, but in a languid, beautiful, floating way. It was a current, slow and constant, and it pulled me along until we reached the shore, where I sat, watching the tide drifting away, knowing that I would never forget that experience. 
 When I first started reading this book, I expected it to be mainly about the rape trial. While I was at first confused that it wasn't, I couldn't stay confused for long. The depth and intense character development in the rest of the story led up to the trial and its outcome - and even events after the trial. 
 One word I'd use to sum up this novel (final thoughts) - 
 Eager. Because while the whole town is languid, underneath the surface a passion is stirring - and it is seen in Atticus and his bravery; Miss Maudie and her garden; Jem and his desire to be like his father; Tom Robinson and his innocent friendship with the poor white girl; and little Scout, who cannot get enough of her world, and who won't let it fly by without having a word or two with it.

Maybe because I've read it in the 2010's, not the 1960's. I know a girl named Scout-possibly after this book-and several others with names like Hunter and Tyler. I can't recall reading a book where the protagonist actually wants to be a lady. I live in a world where it's perfectly normal for girls to play basketball and football, so Scout's tomboyish nature isn't surprising. 
 She doesn't do anything. She's the narrator, but Atticus is the real protagonist. Scout is an innocent bystander. 
 And then there's the structure. The first half is simply ""I live in a small Alabama town where it doesn't snow so we can't make a decent snowman."" Then suddenly, BAM, racism. I can see why so many people reread this. It has that cozy storybook feel to it, like The Hobbit. And a lot of old books now that I think of it. That's how they stay in print. You curl up on the couch on a rainy day and read it for the millionth time. Nostalgia by nature. 
 I don't think it would get published today. The literature world is used to stories that start when the book does, none of this insert lengthy family history stuff. Too slow.

I loved the movie, but there were some serious plotholes I figured would be in the book, so I was so excited to read it. It might be the first time I've ever said this, EVER, but I really think the movie was better than the book. 
 There are a few reasons for this. Kathy, the narrator, often becomes annoying. I think the this author is fantastic because I feel like EVERYTHING that was said or done had a true purpose or motivation, but it really just wasn't my cup of tea I guess. Kathy was telling the story as an adult, but was often recalling her childhood or young adulthood. Everything she said had a justification behind it, and it got taxing. She would say something like, ""This happened, but I never knew it would lead to this...but this is why I did it."" I think that this was important when the author posed the idea of whether or not these clones, these men and women who are basically nothing but spare parts, have souls. Kathy does get very deep and seems to have a great understanding of her actions and their consequences, but she does not seem to really be an adult. It was interesting, and I see the purpose for it, but I just didn't like it much. 
 Secondly, the book seems much more emotionally shallow than the movie. When Ruth admits that she knows it should have been Tommy and Kathy together all this time...if I wouldn't have seen the movie, I would have been like, ""Well, why would you think that? They show no real preference to one another in a romantic way."" Kathy even seems mildly verbally abusive to Tommy. The whole time they are out looking for Kathy's tape in the shops, she calls him an idiot every chance she gets. And then when they do get together, it's so one dimentional. Kathy talks about sex all throughout the novel in a very fleeting way, which is all part of their lifestyle since they cannot have children or marry or have families. I don't know why, but this irked me to no end. I was expecting her to talk about sleeping with Tommy and having it be like nothing she'd ever experienced...but it was like it didn't matter, even with him. 
 Lastly, the climax of the story, I think, should be Tommy getting out of the car after their visit with Madame and Miss Emily and throwing the first fit he'd had in years. In the movie, this was a phenomenal scene and I really just...felt it and understood how devastating it would be...but in the book, that scene barely even registered. 
 So, I guess all I have to wrap it up was that I liked the movie better...and that never happens. It was well written, and I think that had I read it first, I may have viewed the film in an entirely differently light. The movie made the characters more likable (even Ruth) which made me more invested. Oh well.","Thu Feb 17 22:09:38 -0800 2011","Tue Mar 22 00:38:02 -0700 2011","Wed Mar 16 00:00:00 -0700 2011","Thu Feb 17 00:00:00 -0800 2011",0,0

 I liked this book a lot. I read it when I was pretty young, so I probably didn't get everything out of it that I would if I read it now (which I really should, by the way ... if I do, I'll review it more thoroughly). 
 I think this is another book like Gone with the Wind ... a one-time triumph from an author that can never be repeated (which is the reason I'm delaying reading Go Set a Watchman). Atticus Finch is my hero. Scout inspired the main character in one of my novels more than any other character in fiction, just as Jem somewhat inspired another character of mine. The plot is very touching, at times slightly humorous, and overall inspiring. 
 Well, that's all I have to say for now since I've put my two-bits in, even if they're identical to what everyone else has said. :)

 This is probably one of the greatest moral books of our time. A gentle fable that gently leads the reader to confront prejudice in the world, and more importantly, in ourself. We are all Scout, Jen, Boo, Eula May, Bob, Miss Stephanie and Atticus. We all have streaks of mean seated curiosity, strength, oddness, meanness, gossip, and wisdom.

This year I decided to re-read it, alongside Go Set a Watchman, for the sake of having an informed opinion about both. This is such a well-known book that there's no need for another review of it; what follows are some thoughts from this time around. There may be spoilers. 
 What struck me right away is Lee's craft: her writing and storytelling (not the same thing) are both excellent. I have a habit of reading the openings of books when I first bring them home, and sometimes several more times before actually starting to read them, just to whet my appetite. I tried that with this book and didn't stop for more than 50 pages. The story is compelling, every scene comes vividly to life, and yet there's an impressive economy of language - at some point I realized I was moving through the book more slowly than expected, not because it's difficult to read (it isn't) but because every word is important. It is simply a pleasure to read. 
 And yet, I did not fall in love with the characters the way many readers have. I am not generally a fan of stories told through the eyes of young children (even though Scout is recounting events from an adult vantage point, and I enjoyed her voice), and Scout, unsurprisingly for a 6- to 8-year-old, feels a little unformed, at the margins of the real story. At times it felt I was reading a father-son story from the wrong perspective. It was distancing. 
 Whatever else this may be, it does not read like a YA book; novels written before that marketing category existed generally don't. Scout is too young for teen fiction, and the book isn't really about her. One never loses sight of the fact that the other characters in it all have lives that don't revolve around her; that is a sign of good writing, of course. The book does have a tendency to provide explicit moral lessons, generally through Atticus, but I took these scenes less as moralizing at the reader than as a portrayal of a harried single father looking for teachable moments in difficult situations. And the book doesn't make everything explicit: did I realize as a kid that Mayella was sexually abused by her father, that Tom Robinson definitely wasn't climbing a fence, that the sheriff's true concern for Boo isn't an excess of cakes? 
 Of course, some of the book's biggest moral lessons have to do with race, and on that subject there are ways the book has aged very well and ways that it hasn't. Make no mistake: this book is all about white people. The central conflict is between educated, fair-minded white people, who are nonetheless paternalistic in their attitudes, and the rest of the white community, who, as Atticus observes, lose their heads over race. Black people are almost incidental to this conflict - the only semi-developed black character is the housekeeper, Calpurnia, and it's a white man, Atticus Finch, who's positioned as Tom Robinson's savior. 
 With the publication of Go Set a Watchman, there has been talk about Atticus's (and Lee's) views on segregation. It is interesting that this book, published in 1960 and known as a seminal book about race in America, barely addresses what was the great moral and political issue of the day. It is also interesting that, in the early draft (that being Go Set a Watchman), she did - that early version was set in the 1950s, but by Mockingbird it had become historical fiction, taking place in the 30s. That could be viewed as a cop-out: it's always easier to be on the right side of history when you're writing about the past. And yet, the funny thing is that while the great issue of Harper Lee's day has been resolved - no more legally enforced segregation - the issues she reached back into the past to write about - inequality in the criminal justice system; black men being shot by white officials under suspicious circumstances - are still absolutely timely in 2015. 
 Then too, readers would be mistaken to think that Lee could only see the most egregious forms of injustice; there are subtler observations, too. Scout notices, for instance, that white people driving back from the dump use black residents' yards to turn around in. And Calpurnia and her son work menial jobs despite their evident intelligence (she taught him to read using Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England). When Lee does address segregation, it's in the context of white people crossing the color line, never the other way around - but it's evident where she stands. And in that context, I don't believe Atticus, as the moral center of the novel, is a segregationist in his final incarnation. 
 I won't be reading about Atticus's earlier incarnations, though, because in reading this novel, I realized that Watchman is superfluous. We already have Lee's final product, the excellent novel that was the only book she ever meant to publish. I am satisfied to have enjoyed it as Harper Lee intended, and I'll leave it at that.","Tue Apr 19 16:41:44 -0700 2011","Thu Dec 31 17:41:10 -0800 2015","Sat Aug 29 00:00:00 -0700 2015","Tue Aug 25 00:00:00 -0700 2015",15,3

 ""Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing."" 
 This has been on my TBR list since I started my account and got into reading, I just didn't have the opportunity to read it until recently. And with over 3 million reads and 4.25 rating, I really think that there is something wrong with me. 
 Before going further into this review, I need to make a confession: I was in a kind of reading slump and that may have slightly effected my rating and review. 
 Now, I seriously considered NOT finishing this book, the start was so slow and the interesting parts only came later, I was saying that there is something that everybody can see in this book except for me, all my GR friends gave this book 4 or 5 stars and that was driving me crazy, I have only not-finished a book till now and I didn't want to add this book to that list so I decided it is only fair to give it a chance. 
 What I like 
 Fortunately, I ended up liking some parts of the story, the story only caught my attention from the trial onward. I like that it has been written in 1960 and the vibe to it certainly felt good. I can't say that it was nostalgic - I am not that old- but reading a book in that period of time is excellent for a change, and I ended up learning that many things are not as modern as I think they are. 
 Mr.Atticus Finch Character was intriguing and we need many Finches nowadays, that would make the world a better place. I just would have loved if he stood up for himself a little more. 
 The central message of the story is a 5 stars message and I assure you, had I read the book in the 60s (If I was born then), this would have been also a 5 stars book. 
 ""I think there's just one kind of folks. Folks."" 
 What I don't like 
 The slow pacing of the story and the overuse of description were excruciating. I also don't like Scout personality, she was annoying and many times I would confuse her for a boy, her brother Jem, was going through puberty and most children that age are annoying -which means actually that he had a well written character- 
 Also sometimes I would be confused of how did they end up discussing a certain subject, and finally there was a lot of use of the N world -Not in a bad way though- that made me kind of uncomfortable. 
 So I ended up liking some parts and hating others, and I can see why many people like this. Now I finally feel free. 
 In conclusion, I think this book is not as bad as I thought it is, I can actually recommend this to certain readers (I have a target audience for it in my mind), I think the story ends here for me and I am quite sure I am not going to read the second book. My mission finally ends here!","Thu Jun 02 09:03:01 -0700 2016","Thu Jul 06 07:14:15 -0700 2017","Thu Jul 06 10:35:06 -0700 2017","Sun Jul 02 07:43:42 -0700 2017",11,2

I still remember reading the novel during my freshmen year of high school. While some of the themes may have gone over my head, I was immediately attracted to the style of Lee's writing and have always held the book in high regard. The famously reclusive author was recently thrust back into the spotlight when it was announced that her long lost manuscript, Go Set A Watchman, would be published. There continues to be quite a bit of confusion and controversy surrounding the discovery and release of this fifty-year-old story, but I knew that I would be reading it. With this new work, I decided to revisit To Kill A Mockingbird as well. 
 Immediately, Lee's prose transports readers to a simpler time. Through her juvenile protagonist, Scout, Lee documents a coming of age story that dares to tackle racism, ignorance, and justice. Mockingbird is set in Maycomb, Alabama, a picturesque little town, during the 1930's. Scout spends her summer days playing with her older brother Jem and their friend Dill. The trio has a particular interest in their mysteriously reclusive neighbor Boo Radley. Maycomb lore tells cautionary tales against disturbing Boo, but Scout and her gang are determined to sneak up to his house and catch a glimpse of him. 
 Amongst the vignettes of Scout's childhood games and experiences emerges a larger narrative thread that involves her father Atticus. Atticus Finch stands as a shining literary example of what a father is and should aspire to be. His wife died during childbirth, so he has taken to raising his children on his own. As a father and the local town lawyer, Atticus becomes the moral compass for his family and the local justice system. When Tom Robinson, an African-American man, is accused of raping a local woman, Atticus volunteers to defend him. A riveting trial ensues, and Scout begins to witness the ways in which her family and town react to the racially charged proceedings. 
 It is almost impossible to write an objective review of this classic. Harper Lee and To Kill A Mockingbird were placed upon a literary pedestal long before I cracked the spine of this novel. But there is something to be said for the profound effect that this story has on those who read it. Through a lyrically southern voice that instantly captivates your imagination, Lee provides an idyllic tale of innocence that is both nostalgic and equally timely. She writes of the values and integrity that we all aspire to achieve. Justice, understanding, acceptance, faith, perseverance, all are explored through the plainspoken words of a child. Whatever your opinion of the recently released manuscript, the simplicity and beauty of this original novel makes for a deeply moving experience and a quintessential work of American literature.","Sun May 15 22:08:02 -0700 2011","Mon Jul 17 12:30:33 -0700 2017","Thu Sep 17 15:23:59 -0700 2015","Tue Jul 14 00:00:00 -0700 2015",3,0

 Or maybe it was b/c I had to read this stupid thing for class during my Sophmore year. Trust me that english class was just a stab to my brain. Anyways, I only read about 10 chapters out of this whole book, and yet I still got the jist of the story. That's bad...if I can get what's going on with just 10 chapters...then that means nothing happened within the other chapters. That's my idea. 
 Honestly this book dragged on and on, and I would give it nothing if I could. Sadly this book doesn't exist on my shelf anymore, and was given to my sister, who has to read it soon for school. I pitty her, and hey I love reading, but this book made me hate books for the longest time. 
 Sorry to all those who loved this book. Maybe it's just me, and that my brain just didn't want to cope with this book at all. Or maybe it's the lack of magic, dragons, and battles....I don't know.

 LORD OF THE FLIES: THE END OF MY HAPPINESS. ARMAGEDDON OF BOOKS!! 
 ANIMAL FARM: I'll never look at farms the same way again. 
 OF MICE AND MEN: This was . . . this was . . . THIS WAS . . . not so bad, actually. (Was it because it was so short??) 
 ALICE IN WONDERLAND: URRRRGH! This is a children's story?? 
 And then there was the worst one of all . . . 
 ROMEO AND JULIET: (Chucked out the window with a passionate scream.) 
 When I've just about had it with classics . . . I meet this. 
 This . . . this . . . this story of ADORABLENESS. 
 It's ADORABLE. AH-DORABLE. Not just because the narrator is a 6 year old girl, but just because everything that has happened in this book is actually INTERESTING and adorable. 
 So yeah. When my (used to be, because she's quitting her job at my school. WHICH IS WEIRD, because she was on maternity leave for first quarter, and then she didn't even stay for the whole second quarter because she's moving and trying to find another job. But she was such an awesome teacher. BUT WHY IS SHE LEAVING SO SOON, SHE DIDN'T EVEN STAY FOR A WHOLE QUARTER, NOOOOOOOOOOO! So now she's getting a new job...and we're getting a new teacher.) English teacher gave this book to us, she said 
 ""This is my most favorite book in the whole wide world, so children . . . I'm making you read this."" 
 Kind of like how last year, my teacher made us read Watership Down because it was HER favorite book. 
 But I did not dislike this book! I did not dislike this book SO MUCH . . . that I feel really bad that I didn't finish it. 
 I KNOW. Come and yell at me! 
 Come and smack me back and forth and back and forth and left and right ACROSS MY FACE! 
 But no. I didn't finish this book. 
 AND IT WAS HORRIBLE ON MY GRADE. 
 We had this test on the first 10 chapters. When we took that test, I was proudly sitting there with my book marked at Chapter 11. 
 When we had the test on chapter 11-20, I WAS STILL ON CHAPTER 11!! 
 And when we finally took the test on the WHOLE BOOK, I only got to Chapter 17! 
 I just procrastinated. This is a good book, don't get me wrong. I just . . . didn't finish it. 
 Maybe it was because it was homework. Anything that's homework, I'm not going to want to do! 
 If the teacher told me to get out of my house and just walk across the street for homework, I'd probably procrastinate to the last minute. Because there's just this thing in my head that tells me . . . that TEACHERS CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!! 
 Or maybe it's because I'm just lazy. 
 OR MAYBE it's because it was the week before winter break. I mean, I was procrastinating A LOT. I didn't study for my AP World History test on Chapter 13--on Christians and churches and HISTORY (No offense to religious people--I mean, I'm religious, too. BUT WHY IS HISTORY SO BORING?!?!?!?!). 
 My grades aren't straight A's anymore. IT'S AWFUL!!! 
 So, yeah. Yeah. I didn't finish this book. 
 So I can't properly review this book. I didn't properly read the end. AND THE TEST SPOILED IT FOR ME!!! Are you serious?! 
 (view spoiler)[Question 17: Who killed Tom Robinson? 
 And I was sitting there with my mouth open, saying . . . 
 ""TOM ROBINSON GETS KILLED?!?!?!"" (hide spoiler)] 
 So yeah. The ending is already ruined for me and you guys know how I hate being spoiled. 
 And . . . I don't know the book well enough to review it! (Or maybe I'm just lazy.) 
 BUT THIS WAS A GOOD CLASSIC. It will keep you interested if you give it a chance. It's a good book for a classic. 
 I mean, ANYTHING is better than Romeo and Juliet, you know.

Seriously, that's how many reviews To Kill A Mockingbird has on Goodreads. This is going to be a short review because I literally have nothing to add to the conversation. 
 Even if you've never read To Kill A Mockingbird you probably know what it's about. The story is set in 1930s Alabama and told from the point-of-view of eight-year-old Scout. Scout's father is a defense attorney who causes a controversy after he defends a black man in a rape case. This book shows Scout's struggle to make sense of an unjust world. 
 I read this book for the first time when I was thirteen. Thirteen-year-old me was an avid reader of classics, but I mostly stuck to the sci-fi/fantasy/horror classics. I couldn't get into the realistic ones. This book helped me realize that realistic classics didn't have to be about stuffy British people who attend a lot of dinner parties. Many of the characters in this book are children, and the author perfectly captures the humor, mysteries, and confusion of growing up in a small town. Even though thirteen-year-old me had never been to Alabama, I remember the vivid rural setting of the novel pulling me in. It was a setting that I could (and still can) relate to. 
 When I first read this book, I was young enough that it had an impact on how I saw the world. To Kill A Mockingbird is about looking past a person's outward appearance and reputation. It's about trying your hardest to be fair to others. It taught me that I have to stand up for what I believe, even if it's hard or unpopular, but I still need to respect people who believe differently than me. It has always impressed me that a book could teach me so much without being preachy. 
 ""I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what."" 
 ""People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for."" 
 ""They're certainly entitled to think that, and they're entitled to full respect for their opinions . . . but before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience."" 
 I'm glad I got a chance to reread this book.","Sun Mar 27 12:56:57 -0700 2016","Tue Mar 29 07:57:25 -0700 2016","Wed Mar 23 00:00:00 -0700 2016","",1,0

 I grew up with the Robert Mulligan movie and always perceived it as a somewhat autobiography of Harper Lee and definitely related more to the subject of being fancy free as a child and learning from the world around rather than completely absorbing the stark, important message of prejudice and justice that collides with the issue of racism in the story. But this is really about the importance of Atticus, because he is the driving force of Scout's subjectiveness and the axis of her moral values; the last few words of the book are of Scout reflecting the love her father has for her and her brother described through an action: Sitting at Jem's bedside all night till he wakes. 
 I've been a fan of the movie for years--and there's not denying Gregory Peck's fantastic performance--but there's no doubt that the book is far better. The only reasons I have for saying so is that the movie is pretty much just a cinematic version of the book give or take several scenes and declarations of Scout and her point of view. But, like most on-screen versions of popular novels, the 1962 film gives perfect faces to the characters. Can you imagine if Cary Grant or Peter O'Toole played the role of Atticus? They would live up to their reputations as actors, but would lack character traits and behaviors (O'Toole would be too soft in appearance and voice, and Grant would lack the natural tranquility of Atticus' character). The roles of the children are spot on in the movie as well--especially Mary Badham as Scout. I suppose performance is all that matters in the film anyway because the original story is primarily lead with character development and realization as opposed to plot. 
 For me, and many others, Atticus is really what made this book. I was more interested in Atticus than Scout and Jem and wished that there was a whole book dedicated to Atticus from his point of view as a prequel telling how he met Jem and Scout's mom, his years in law school, and that involve flashbacks of his childhood with his family (there must be a fan fiction out there somewhere...) God, I can't even describe how much I personally admire Atticus. It's an ongoing, but true, joke in my family that Atticus Finch is the Optimus Prime of American Lit. Both characters are on par with each other on all characteristic levels: Both are respected and loved by those they raise/lead, both hold firm to their moral values--including justice--even if it may cost them their lives, both have a tender authority that attracts others around, you want both to be your father, I could go on. Yep, Atticus Finch hits my top favorite characters in Lit. next to Siever Genarr (Asimov's Nemesis) and Nick Carraway (Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby). 
 This was such a great book, and my excuse for knocking off a star is probably the most cliche but true factoid among ALL readers: It just didn't hit me hard enough to stay completely interested. Every time I put it down I was more like ""...eh"" instead of needing to stay up all night till I reach the last page. Lame, I know, but my opinion deserves a star too despite this novel's excellence. Great read, highly recommend it for anyone who wants a good, warm read about facing the world's issues through the eyes of a child.","Fri Nov 20 20:54:11 -0800 2015","Wed Aug 10 13:20:32 -0700 2016","Sat Dec 05 00:00:00 -0800 2015","Fri Nov 20 00:00:00 -0800 2015",0,0

 The book takes a child's point of view and does so brilliantly. Like any good story, it explores its theme with out explicitly lecturing about it. That is probably why not all of us are able to understand it. 
 The title itself is fine example. There are no mocking bird - dead or alive, in the story but the title is metaphor for acts that destroy a child's innocence and trough the story, you find characters whose innocence gets destroyed. 
 The story explores how children go through various stages with regard to their views on morality. Also, it is pointed out, beautifully, that you can't understand a person unless you see life in his/her way.Another important theme is gender differences. That is even if you leave behind other more common theme like racism and pride. 
 Initially, i thought it is famous only because it is all literature. Also it was based american urban life and as such, I won't like it but, the book is like a poem of humanity and equally enjoyable to all. 
 .... and what is above all it explores those themes with a good humor.","Thu Apr 11 00:00:00 -0700 2013","Fri Dec 23 03:39:40 -0800 2016","Mon Jan 20 00:00:00 -0800 2014","",3,0

Eventually, I began co-teaching English II with my best friend, my sister, who also loves TKAM. We taught the shit out of this book. We LOVED teaching this book together, reading it aloud together. And because we loved it with such an obvious and visible passion, our students loved it, too (I still have former students come up to me and share their Mockingbird memories). TKAM made such an impression on my sister, she named my nephew William Atticus, after one of its most beloved characters (Go Set a Watchman doesn't count!!!). 
 Flash forward years later. I've been a librarian for 9 years, so it's been that long since I've had the opportunity to return to Maycomb. It's February 19, 2016. My sister and I are in the hallway outside the hospital room where our mom is dying. We are devastated and lost. We're skimming our phones when we see Harper Lee has died. We are moved and know Mom won't be far behind. She wasn't. 
 Flash forward two months. It's April and my son is failing English (I know, right???). His class is finishing the year with Mockingbird. Students are expected to read the book 100% on their own. I know my son. I know he will not read this book. I refuse to let that happen. Yes, part of the reason is that I don't want him to fail, but a bigger reason is because this book is so important to my sister and me and his sister, too. And because I know I can make him love it, I convince him to let us read the book together (and by together I mean let me read it aloud to him). He agrees. And that experience is now one of my all-time favorite parenting memories. I savored every night I got to read this book aloud again. All my voices came right back to me, my cadence, the questions I would stop and ask, all of it. Jake was an attentive audience, he laughed and was outraged in all the right places. He made excellent predictions. He answered all the questions correctly. He made wise connections and observations. He made intelligent jokes. My favorite was when he texted me to say that he read in class that day, not waiting for me to read to him that night, and he already knew that Tom came back to life and Boo Radley was a Ninja. How excited he was when we got to the end and it turned out that Boo really was a Ninja - well, kinda. 
 I always cried in certain parts of the book while reading aloud to my classes (""Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passin',"" and, ""Hey, Boo,"" just to name two), but reading aloud to my son just two months after my mom's death was an exponentially more emotional experience. Aside from my near hysterics reading the last few chapters (poor Jake), the chapter that made me cry the most (that didn't even used to choke me up) was Chapter 11 - the chapter on courage, the chapter about Mrs. Dubose. As I read the last page when Atticus is telling Jem about Mrs. Dubose's death and how she was the bravest woman he ever knew, I was overcome. Jake let me cry for several minutes, then he cleared his throat and read the rest of the chapter aloud to me. 
 What a blessing to me that Jake's teacher chose not to read Mockingbird aloud to her classes (thank you, Jenni George for pointing that out to me). If she would have, I would have missed out on sharing it with Jake. I would have missed out on revisiting Maycomb and the story and the characters and the memories that mean so, so much to me.","Wed Sep 11 13:18:01 -0700 2013","Sun May 08 07:04:56 -0700 2016","Wed May 04 00:00:00 -0700 2016","",3,0

 Things that struck me about it this time through: 
 - the dialogue. Just damn! She nailed it. I was sucked into the story within 10 pages because of her natural and believable dialogue, which also helped make the world of Maycomb that much more real. 
 - Maycomb as a character. At a writing conference last year, one of the speakers said, ""If you can pick up your story and characters and move them to another city or place and still be able to tell the same story, then your setting isn't working hard enough."" Well TKAM wouldn't work in ANY other setting, and Maycomb played as much a vital role to the outcome of the story as any one person did. 
 - The story takes on this creepy vibe at certain parts, so there's this underlying sense of terror without it ever being a horror novel. She's able to create this unsettling tone in many places, and the horror becomes a real sense of horror - like how could those people do that to that man? or how could anyone want to hurt children? - yet the book never loses its sense of childhood innocence during those moments. 
 - having an adult narrator tell a story from her childhood's point of view is tricky and well done. how she managed to find a balance between the sensitivities and understanding of the adult and the innocence and naivite and curiosity of the child was kind of mind blowing at times.","Wed Sep 07 10:44:12 -0700 2011","Mon Jan 14 07:53:34 -0800 2013","Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 -0800 2013",0,0

This is one of those books which are socially relevant and so don't get relegated back to the dusty shelves where they belong. It's considered to be an indictment against racism in American society, but I did not find it all that powerful. 
 For one thing, we look at the entire issue of racism from a white point of view, which basically just skims over the daily humiliations and trials of being a black person in the segregated and racist society of the American South. The Finch family is the primary focus of the book, especially the two children (Scout and Jem), who have no knowledge of these issues, right till the end of the book. The legal case only takes up a small part of the book and while it makes a point about inherent racism in the courts, it really does not dig deep into the issue. 
 The story-telling is rather lacking with paper-thin characters and no actual focus. The book is divided into two parts and the first part is almost entirely Scout and Jem and their daily lives, which I found pretty pointless. They go on endlessly about their silly games and there is far too much attention given to some mysterious neighbour who doesn't really serve a purpose except to act as a deus-ex machina at the end. The second part is better structured but even here, it is still about the Finch family. 
 Child narrators almost always have a major problem with lack of understanding of the world around them, which does not work for me at all as a narrative. Looking at the story through the lens of an innocent white girl serves no purpose. She has no clue about the harshness of the lives of black people because she is sheltered, ignorant and innocent. If a child's viewpoint was even required, which I would definitely argue against, why not a black child who would have the right experience. Maybe even Tom Robinson's daughter? 
 There is not much done in terms of character development, except for Scout herself, and perhaps her brother. But these two should not be the focus of this story because they are really peripheral characters looking at the action taking place around them. Atticus Finch borders on a Gary Stu character. On a more personal level, I could not connect to the characters or to the story except in a few rare instances. 
 I did like a few scenes, especially the courtroom ones. I found Mayela Ewell the most interesting character in the book and would have enjoyed a bit more focus on her and how she felt about her life and her lies. Scout's development of a relationship with her aunt got me interested in spite of myself. But overall, I don't think this book even does its job properly. I found it hugely problematic that for an acclaimed novel against racism, the black characters aren't developed much or even exist for the most part in the narrative.","Thu Aug 27 13:23:11 -0700 2015","Sun May 07 08:15:54 -0700 2017","Mon Aug 31 15:48:42 -0700 2015","Thu Aug 27 00:00:00 -0700 2015",15,5

 After a lot of procrastination, I finally picked up the book. Scout quickly became my favorite character. I found her witty and quite intriguing. I just loved her sense of humor. The way she tries to make excuses to avoid school had me laughing hard. 
 ""Do you defend niggers, Atticus?"" I asked him that evening. 
 ""Of course I do. Don't say nigger, Scout. That's common."" 
 ""'s what everybody at school says."" 
 ""From now on it'll be everybody less one--"" 
 ""Well if you don't want me to grow up talkin' that way, why do you send me to school?"" 
 Liked the way Harper Lee has written it. It was a smooth flow of words and the book doesn't bore you. 
 Atticus is shown as genuine person and not portrayed like a superhero. I was hooked to the book during the second half of the story i.e. when Tom Robinson trial began. 
 It has a powerful message and portrayed beautifully.

That was the reason why I was putting this off, even though I was interested in the topic and liked the fact that it was set in the South in the 1930s. I also wanted to see why this is considered as one of the greatest American novels of all time. Well, I did see where people were coming from and why this is such a loved story, especially in the United States. It had this charming and nostalgic atmosphere, which made me want to go back in time when I was a carefree child. Had I read this during the summer, I would have had a glass of lemonade in my hand while sitting on the garden swing in a warm breeze of wind. 
 Lee knows how to evoke the sweet childhood alongside the serious undertone of the trial and racial issues. It soon becomes clear that the prejudice and mean-spiritedness towards certain groups of people is incomprehensible to children, which I personally think shows that it is completely unnecessary and ridiculous. In the story one of the teachers abhors Hitler's actions, but at the same time says that it was about time someone taught the Negroes a lesson because they didn't stay in their proper place anymore. What a load of crappy hypocrisy, Ms. Whatever-her-name-was. I would also say (based on the book and my own experiences) that racism is a completely learned behaviour. Children repeat what they hear at home, they don't even necessarily know the meaning of the words they're spitting out, let alone why it is wrong to say such things. 
 However, had I read this earlier in life it would have probably worked a lot better for me. I'd say that this would serve its purpose in schools' compulsory reading lists. Adolescents at a certain stage in their lives would take out a lot from this. I understand why people love this so much, but at the same time I can't consider it as nothing more than one of many canonical classics. Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath for example is in my opinion many ways far superior, whereas Lee falls short in both her writing and characterizations (mostly with the children).","Tue Jun 24 04:02:35 -0700 2008","Mon Aug 05 12:36:05 -0700 2013","Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 -0800 2012","Thu Jan 05 00:00:00 -0800 2012",0,0

 I LOVED this book! Such a beautiful, simplistic story of 2 little children, only it is so much more! The characters were simply amazing! I love Scout (aka Jean Louise Finch). She is just the sweetest little spitfire ever! I love her attitude, her thirst for knowledge, and her love of reading. And every time she crawled up in Atticus's lap, my heart melted completely! <3 <3 <3 And Jem. The typical big brother. I love his imagination, his protectiveness towards Scout, and his tender heart. There were times I just wanted to wrap him in my arms and give him a hug! He reminds me so much of my own brothers, which is perhaps why I like him so much. Let's not forget Atticus. The Best. Character. Ever. I love how he was such an amazing man, yet the author still portrayed his flaws, making him realistic and relatable. I am having a hard time describing him, because he is just so darn awesome! And Boo Radley . . . yeah. We'll just leave it at that! <3 
 The writing style was quite unique in this book, and I have to say, as much as I liked pretty much everything else about this book, I wasn't really a fan of the writing style. It was somewhat confusing, and I found myself rereading sentences 2 or 3 times just to comprehend what she was trying to say. Otherwise, I loved this book! Definitely something I will read again and again! 
 CONTENT NOTE: (view spoiler)[There was a decent amount of language in this book. Nothing absolutely terrible, but definitely a bit more than mild, and more than I am comfortable with on a regular basis.

 This book has over 3 million ratings on Goodreads, over 70 000 reviews and a crap-ton of reviews elsewhere as well, so I know I am not first one to rave about how good this book was, nor will I be the last. 
 This book has great characters and a great plot. The fact that all the events taking place in this book, is told through the eyes of a child, made this book ten times more gripping and captivating. I think it made everything feel a little bit more real. 
 This book deals with racism, equality and inequality, and most importantly it portrays courage. 
 There is a lot to learn from this book, and that is partially why I would strongly advise you to read it. 
 I loved this book and it is now one of my favourite books of all time and I want to read it again already. However, I think this book is one of those you either love, or don't like at all. I can see where this book may not appeal to every reader out there, but I would still advise everybody to pick this up.

 the book: 
 US, Alabama, 1935. Scout and Jem are the two children of Atticus Finch, a lawyer. Atticus has to defend a black man, who is suspected of the rape of a white girl. He cannot deny the case, because that'd mean no job, which means no money. And that's why he has to defend the man, even tough he knows the case is already lost because of the difference between black and white people. Lots of terrible things will happen, because Atticus defends a black man. But when the thruth is revealed, will people set the man free, or won't they, because he's black? 
 review: 
 I have no idea how to review a book this good. To me this is an important piece of american history. The story is told from Scout, a nine-year-old girl, point of view, which makes is less difficult to read, which was great for me. I like to know what I'm reading :) I think that this story wouldn't have been as good as it is if it was told from e.g. Atticus's point of view, Scout really made the story funny with her childlike innocence. The author made me want to read literature, something I'd think I would not like. 
 This story is out of my comfort zone, but still I loved it, and I know I will read more literature. I hope all literature is as good as this book. Then English classes will be fun in the next 3 years :D (I'm in year 9 now) 
 The characters were very developed and thought-through, which made the book easier to read. You did not have to care about some very bad characters, and I fell in love with all of them. I kind of felt like I knew every family that lived in this village, and that I knew all about them. 
 I could relate to Scout in many ways. I was like she is, always being boy-ish. My parents also are like Atticus, teaching me to read before school started. 
 *I think I can go on rambling about this book forever* 
 Altogether, I think many newer stories were based on this one, and this book has been a source of inspiration for tons of books, writers and readers. Definitely worth the Pulitzer Prize it recieved!","Sun Nov 06 11:30:01 -0800 2011","Mon Jan 30 10:33:46 -0800 2012","Sun Jan 29 00:00:00 -0800 2012","Thu Jan 05 00:00:00 -0800 2012",0,1

 August was a horrible month for reading as it was busy with work, family and trying to get some writing in. If you can believe it - I read and listened to only twelve books and many were shorter novels. Despite not having too much time to read I did finish To Kill a Mockingbird before September and enjoyed every moment of it. 
 As I listened to Sissy Spacek narration of Harper Lee's novel I found myself almost reading this as if it was my first time. When I first read this novel as a preteen I understood the basic principle of the racial issues and of right and wrong and it frustrated me. I wanted good to prevail and have everyone have a group hug and ride off in the sunset. On my second reading, in my mid-twenties, I was more aware of the elements behind the issues and it angered me. I wanted blood from the bad, shame the bystanders, stand on my soapbox demanding idealism and justice. This time (turning 35 later this month) when I listened to the words written by the incomparable Lee I took in the pain, injustice and reality and I cried. I cried with Scout. I felt what she did but instead of applying myself into the novel I walked in the characters' s shoes. I am fortunate to have had this novel by my side as I grew into a more compassionate person. I still want to change...and rage against...the world but I want the peace that many of the heroes strived for. 
 Lee's editor was brilliant in zeroing in on Jean Louise's childhood and having her focus her novel around young Scout. Through this character Lee is able to give us the good and bad of Maycomb, circa the Great Depression. We see the innocence of morality, the awakening of consciencness and the ultimate compassion. This is not just a novel of a small town in Alabama that houses racists, bullies, small minds or lowbrow people that strikes it's readers for change. It is a novel that Lee wrote from her own experiences and childhood memeories but also a novel that asks you to look at the world from more than one point of view. 
 The fact that this novel is a banned book only makes me more proud to call this piece of literature one of my favourites of all time. Any book can allow me to be carried away to another place and time but it takes something special to take me to another place and time but give me a different perspective each time. I would recommend this novel to everyone - you may love it or hate it but you will feel something. 
 I apologize that this isn't quite a review as much as a reflection. I think for me this is one book that I can't be as objective as I wanted to be. This proves interesting as I will be reading Go Set a Watchman this month. Other than being excited to read more of Harper Lee's writing I am not sure how I feel going into the book.

 This novel takes place in the South in the 1960s. Told from a young girl's point-of-view we get the story of how a black man is accused of raping a white woman. Scout, the young girl, watches her father take this case and teach them that life is not fair but if you believe in something you do all you can. Scout and her older brother, Jem are teased by other children and looked down by the adults. 
 What a GREAT read - haunting, heartwarming, outrageous, heroic, etc. This is more than a coming to age story but a story of life lessons and what is right.","Mon Jul 21 20:49:16 -0700 2014","Tue Sep 01 23:24:19 -0700 2015","Thu Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 2004","",8,6

I remember taking the book home with homework to read the first chapter. I finished it. I remember loving the book then, but I had forgotten how the plot ended. 
 The book is written in third person from the perspective of Jean Louise Finch (who is called Scout). Her father is a well respected member of the state legislature, and is the defence attorney assigned the defence of Tom Robinson, a black man in 1930s Alabama, accused of the rape of a white 19 year old, Mayella Ewell. 
 Although the court case is almost a sub-plot in the novel, it is a vehicle to explore the Finch family's attitude to the world they live in as we follow Scout, who is 9 by the end of the novel, as she tries to figure out her place in Maycombe society. It's a fascinating snapshot of life and society attitudes in 1930s Alabama. 
 This novel is an interesting book. It works on many levels as a novel which makes you think, it's an enjoyable plot and has creatively drawn characters and has a number of sub-plots. 
 I'm really glad that I read it again, and I am now looking forward to reading Go Set a Watchman.","Wed Jul 15 00:00:00 -0700 2015","Wed Dec 21 13:58:02 -0800 2016","Sun Jul 19 00:00:00 -0700 2015","",0,0

Questions most adults don't ask themselves, things adults forgot to ask about how they run their life and reflect on it. I get annoyed at Scout in some moments but that is how kids are sometimes, same goes with Dilly and Jem. Thing is, Scout's POV is so refreshing I didn't mind the most parts where she was annoying. I love how the story progressed along the way, I love how her relationship to her father and to her brother was told, alongside her extended family, neighbors, and Calpurnia and the rest of the black society. 
 Prejudice is one of man's greatest flaw, to think that he is above everyone else. And this book has showed me how an act of prejudicism affected children, and how those children reacted to such action. This has been a very emotional read for me, and this will be one of my favorites that I will surely love to visit again and again.

On top of that, it still resonates today.

This is a book that CAN be read twice and I guess even more times. I loved the book when I read it a little short of 50 years ago, and I loved it this time too. For different reasons. Last time I read it when I was about 11 or 12, when everybody was reading it. This time it was refreshing to attack it from a completely different angle, without hearing all the fuss from others. There is a new book about TKAM and the the author, Harper Lee. It shows that much of this novel is autobiographical. That Dill could be based on Capote! I will have to read this book: !Scout, Atticus, and Boo: A Celebration of Fifty Years of To Kill a Mockingbird. I need to know more about Harper Lee!!! 
 Last time I read TKAM there was so much talk about racial issues, and I read it then, even as a child, with this as the main focus. It IS an excellent glimpse of the South in the mid-thirties. It so well depicts how life unfurled itself then and there. 
 This time around what struck me was the love between the different characters. Love in all its different aspects and ways. Love between a father and his children, love between brother and sister, love between a young ""tomboy"", Scout, and and her friend Dill. And there is more. Their is love and understanding between the people living in the small town of Alabama. Maybe one can not classify it as romantic love, but all of these ""loves"" are so beautiful to see and watch. Such love is down-to-earth and real and honest and without any pretense. The author says on the back of my splotched and ripped and yellowed copy that she saw this as a love story. I read this note at the end and understood it immediately. This time around, this is exactly what I got out of the book. 
 I adored the prose. the sentences that erupted from the characters' mouths, the dialogue, the ideas expressed. I personally fell in love with Atticus, the father of Scout. What a father. He had alot to teach me to, still even in my old age..... He and his children were continually reminding each other that ""it is not yet time to worry."" I love that statement b/c it does not deny that horrible things are going on but we are not yet at the point where we must fall apart and collapse. In all its honesty it calms you down. You can tell yourself to just cool it! This will be my new motto!!! And I love Scout and Jem and Dill........ and Boo! 
 Another thing - the title and how the story plays out are so very important. I will not talk about these things here b/c that would be a spoiler. You have to read the book first. Or you have to read it again, as I had to. After you have read the book, several of us at the Group Comfort Reads have discussed the book and what it meant to us. Here is a link to that thread: http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/3... . Many of the things I want to talk about here are voiced there. I wrote a couple of rather lengthy bits. See meassages 82, 86 and 89 if you are curious. 
 REALLY DO READ THIS BOOK AGAIN, and for heavens sake if you have never read it, get it NOW! 
 P.S. It is so strange that I totally love this book - it is pure fiction. Or maybe I love it because I can feel that what the author says is based on true events. Probably I feel this b/c it is partially autobiographical.","Thu Dec 06 04:56:17 -0800 2007","Mon Aug 28 19:53:04 -0700 2017","Sun Aug 01 00:00:00 -0700 2010","Sat Jul 24 00:00:00 -0700 2010",14,19

 It's a beautiful story, written beautifully. It isn't for the reader who only looks for pace and twists in a book. It's for those who read a book and take away lessons from it. It's for those who would like to be carried away by two children to a place and time everyone wishes never existed. It's for those who look for hope in this world where it seems bleak.

 Actual Rating: 3.5 stars 
 Going into this book, my expectations were probably too high because of how well-known and acknowledged it is. Or maybe it's because I don't usually read books similar to this. Nevertheless, I didn't enjoy this book as much as I would've liked to. 
 To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee is a classic in American literature. It's about life in the South through the eyes of two children, Scout and Jem Finch, and the hardships they face when their father, Atticus, defends a black man accused of rape. 
 The Good: 
 To Kill a Mockingbird accurately depicts childhood and growing up. It reminded me of all the stupid things I would do as a kid and how much I missed having a carefree life (now mine is occupied with homework, projects, and studying). I loved seeing Scout and Jem mature and question and learn about the world around them even though it wasn't pleasant. I also loved seeing the emotions they go through: 
 ""'That's what I thought, too,' he said at last, 'when I was your age. If there's just one kind of folks, why can't they get along with each other? If they're alike, why do they go out of their way to despise each other?'"" 
 The most interesting character in this novel is Atticus. People like him are rare. He has a heart made of gold, and Scout and Jem are proud to look up to him. I learned a lot from him, and the things he said made me think about the person I am. He has good morals and teaches them to his children: 
 ""You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . . . Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it."" 
 ""I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what."" 
 The ending was also amazing. I won't say much about it, but the ending saved the book for me. 
 The Bad: 
 This book took me much longer to read than most other books. It just didn't fully captivate my attention. Sometimes, I almost had to force myself to keep on reading. I would often zone out during the long descriptions and reread them to help me focus on the story. 
 Another thing I didn't like was how the main plot came much later in the story. The beginning of the book focused on various childhood events that only briefly mention the court case. The purpose of this was to develop the world and characters, but it was done too slowly. 
 Overall, I still enjoyed this book despite how boring it could get at times. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a humorous, character-driven historical fiction novel.","Mon Jan 16 15:54:13 -0800 2017","Sat Jan 28 14:42:23 -0800 2017","Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 -0800 2017","Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 -0800 2017",1,2

I actually had not read any classics by my own volition until I grabbed this one, so I will always cherish To Kill a Mockingbird as my first. At first, I didn't even know what the book was about, really. I just remember choosing this one because I had heard its title a bunch of times, plus it had a really beautiful cover (yes, I am one of those guys...). I remember thinking that it was bound to be, at least, average, otherwise it wouldn't have acquired such fame. And it was much more than that. To this day, few books have had the same general impact on me as a human being as this one. The powerful lessons expressed through every character, especially Atticus Finch, are unique and everlasting. 
 I could say that this book is nothing more than a coming of age story about day-to-day life in a small Alabama town during the Great Depression, but it is. To Kill a Mockingbird, in its simplicity, emanates waves of warmth through totally believable and relatable characters. Enduring characters like the Finches, Calpurnia and Boo Radley are rare, but when they come up they tend to stay with the readers for generations. Atticus Finch, by being such a beacon of righteousness to the kids, has done the same for me as well. The most admirable thing about him is his ability to influence the kids, constantly leading them to the right direction regarding moral and general behavior, while letting them interact with society and find out the workings of the world on their own. Also, the way Atticus talks to the kids is something that everyone should learn: to interact with children as if they are adults; by doing so, Atticus makes sure the children know their opinions are being taken seriously and that they are respected. I wish every parent was like that! God knows how disgusted I get whenever I see parents interacting with their kids as if they are some kind of injured puppy or something... Well, to wrap this all up, I wish I could have read To Kill a Mockingbird sooner so that I would have been inspired by its awesomeness from a younger age. 
 Regarding the narrative, I found it light and easy flowing; there is no excess of detail descriptions, no sudden unexplained events or anything poorly executed. Everything makes sense and fits the rhythm of the story perfectly. Still, it was only a third or so into the book that I began to understand why it is what it is. When I got there, the first part felt really less significant than I had thought. In fact, it only served to introduce all the characters - their relationships, personalities, motivations and moral standpoints. After that, though, the core of the story is slowly built until it comes to the famous courtroom scene - and I found it to be as remarkable as everyone had said it would. The events that come right after are equally shocking. Even though our society, unfortunately, still is not near being prejudice free, the lengths to which people of that time would go to ascertain that their prejudicial views were being hold by legal authorities left me astounded. 
 To Kill a Mockingbird was truly beyond its time and I find its messages very much relevant. That is what characterizes quality literature: the property of transcending time and having the same impact on several generations as it had on the first reader. All things considered, this is an incredible book that reminded me, once more, of how important it is to at least try to treat everyone with equal respect. Also, this book is extremely powerful in its discussion of racism, tolerance and human behavior. Considering that I come from a town where most people will look at you as if you are trash if you don't suit up to go to the mall to watch a movie, I can't possibly read too much about such lessons. I really do not ever want to turn into one of those people. 
 Interesting quotes that I didn't include in the review: 
 You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it. 
 People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for. 
 The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience. 
 People in their right minds never take pride in their talents.","Wed Mar 08 19:37:51 -0800 2017","Thu Jun 29 11:25:21 -0700 2017","Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 2013","",0,0

 The story of racism seen through the eyes of children and told in a manner understandable by them explains why this book has been on many high school curricula and makes for a very adequate introduction to racial equality to all young minds. 
 While most of the content is understandably already familiar to me, considering how much media coverage there is on the central theme of the novel, I found some of the standpoints of Atticus Finch, who serves as the main pillar of morality for the children, to be quite insightful. That is not to say that Atticus' concepts of equality are what caught my attention, but the manner in which he brings up his two children, Scout and Jem, makes for a brilliant environment to raise children in, and fully allows them to explore their own moral terrain and gives room to corrective behavior which most children are capable of before they are socially polarized to have opinions on some social issues. 
 A brilliant read and I highly recommend it, not for the central theme, but to understand the concept of social polarization, the dangers of it, and to remind oneself that people already know the answer to questions on human dignity.","Tue Nov 20 23:03:00 -0800 2012","Fri Mar 07 09:08:14 -0800 2014","Wed Mar 05 00:00:00 -0800 2014","Wed Feb 12 00:00:00 -0800 2014",0,0

 4.5 stars 
 To Kill A Mockingbird was my book club book for this month. I had never read it before and I see now why it is such a classic. It was a great read. It is simple and easy to follow, but written in such a way that it entertained me from the first word until the last. Just a really great story. 
 I was surprised that the story was not as much about black vs white as I had thought going into it. Before reading it I had heard of it of course, but didn't really know the story. I knew there was some talk about race, but I thought that would be most of the story and I didn't think it was. I felt like it was more about people in general and how we treat each other based on various different things, one of them being the color of your skin. Really there is all of the hierarchy of people that everyone is in within their groups. Like Scout couldn't befriend Walter Cunningham because her aunt wouldn't let her. Why? Because he is a Cunningham and Cunningham's are beneath them. They are trash. It was really interesting how it was more about how we treat people in general. Yes, there is the black guy Tom and his trial and that whole racial tension part to it, but it is more than just that. I loved the story. 
 It was interesting as the one lady in book club felt like nothing really happened in the book, nothing really changed. I found that not to be true. This book was written at that time when the people are on the cusp of change. It shows how change happens slowly, it doesn't happen overnight. You keep fighting and you can change things. The jurors took hours to come back with a guilty conviction instead of minutes like it would have been. Sure it is not perfect yet, but it is setting up for the next time when maybe it won't be that they will convict just based on the color of the skin even if the person is obviously not guilty. Feelings are slowly changing and people are starting to think more about the way they are looking at things. Change doesn't happen overnight, but this showed how you can slowly start to influence people and their ways of doing things. 
 Atticus was of course the perfect moral compass. He was always level headed and kind to everyone. He didn't hold grudges and just wanted everyone to be treated equally. He didn't think less of the Cunninghams because they didn't have money, or the black people, or anyone really. He was just a great influence on everyone. He is just that all around good person in the story that if you needed to know if something was right or wrong you could look to him and what he thought. Not that he was really perfect, he did have some slight flaws that I don't even know were supposed to be there. Like his views on women are not 100% equal which I found interesting. Still for the most part he is the person to look to for right and wrong. 
 I am glad it was written in the point of view of a child. It was nice to see how she grew and was influenced by everyone around her. It was nice watching her try and figure out what is right and wrong, how to fit in someone else's skin and see it from their point of view. Really a great read and no wonder it is such a classic. Even though it was written some time ago it still feels relevant today. It is not one of those books where you just can't identify with what is happening and the people of the time because everything is so different. It still works today. Really loved this book and I am glad it was chosen for our book club read this month.","Sat Jan 03 13:48:59 -0800 2015","Sat Jan 03 13:49:34 -0800 2015","Mon Dec 01 00:00:00 -0800 2014","",0,0

Her father was a former newspaper editor and proprietor, who had served as a state senator and practiced as a lawyer in Monroeville. Lee studied law at the University of Alabama from 1945 to 1949, and spent a year as an exchange student in Oxford University, 
 Wellington Square. Six months before finishing her studies, she went to New York to pursue a literary career. She worked as an Airline reservation clerk with Eastern Air Lines and British Overseas Airways during the 1950s. In 1959 Lee accompanied Truman Capote to Holcombe, Kansas, as a research assistant for Capote's classic 'non-fiction' novel In Cold Blood (1966). 
 To Kill a Mockingbird was Lee's first novel. 
 ""Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."" 
 The story takes place during three years of the Great Depression in the fictional ""tired old town"" of Maycomb, Alabama. It focuses on six-year-old Scout Finch, who lives with her older brother Jem and their widowed father Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer. The three children are terrified of, and fascinated by, their neighbor, the reclusive ""Boo"" Radley. The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo and, for many years, few have seen him. The children feed each other's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house. Following two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone is leaving them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place. Several times, the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, never appears in person. 
 Atticus is appointed by the court to defend Tom Robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, Mayella Ewell. Although many of Maycomb's citizens disapprove, Atticus agrees to defend Tom to the best of his ability. Other children taunt Jem and Scout for Atticus' actions, calling him a ""nigger-lover"". Scout is tempted to stand up for her father's honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. For his part, Atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching Tom. 
 It was the first time I read this novel though of course I had heard about it on several occasions. I read some of the reviews before starting it and those gave me the idea the book was harsh and horrible, some even went as far as to say the book should be banned cause it was racist amongst other things. I think this books very well put down the idea of black people in that era. I think the book is very clear how unfair they have been treated on many occasions. I enjoyed very much the ideas the children came up with for their creepy neighbor, it reflected very well how children deal with things they cannot get their heads around. 
 I did enjoy the story of Tom Robinson too, it was clear he was innocent but did not stand a change. But it was good to see that not all people agreed with how things went. 
 What I did have a problem with was the use of language, I got the hang of it at some point but as a Dutch person reading in English it was difficult at first to get a grip on the Southern language used in the book. It did help though with setting the atmosphere. 
 I think the characters where described very well. They really came alive and it was easy to empathize with them. The description of the street and the houses what was where was very well too. You could imagine walking down a street, seeing children play and that one dark, abandoned looking house on the corner.","Wed Dec 14 04:11:23 -0800 2011","Mon Jan 09 09:25:34 -0800 2012","Mon Jan 09 06:36:44 -0800 2012","Thu Jan 05 12:46:37 -0800 2012",0,0

At age 16, I was impressed by how much Scout learns about the world through the experiences of Tom Robinson's trial, ""Boo"" Radley's protection, and her interactions with Dill, the Ewells, her teachers, and of course her father Atticus. I learned about the power of empathy and about following one's conscience. 
 I re-read Mockingbird as a 32-year-old, this time from the perspective of a father. This time, I was enthralled by the way Atticus Finch parents his young children (who are close in age to my own two). He is honest, steady, and patient. He never loses his cool, but uses each of his children's mistakes (no matter how serious) as a teaching opportunity. He is the kind of teacher and father that I would like to be. 
 This time I was also more deeply impressed at Harper Lee's remarkable book than I was in high school. She really allows you to ""crawl inside the skin"" of each character -- even bad 'ol Mr. Ewell. There is just so much beauty, art, and feeling in this book... it brought a lump to my throat several times. Rooted in a time and place, Mockingbird's themes and characters are timeless.","Mon Apr 15 23:50:32 -0700 2013","Mon May 09 18:37:34 -0700 2016","Fri Apr 19 00:58:37 -0700 2013","Mon Apr 15 00:00:00 -0700 2013",0,0

While the movie with Gregory Peck was excellent, I still prefer the book. If you haven't read it, do so. It's one of the shorter, better classics & has aged superbly. 
 I first read this when I was in my teens (quite close to Jem's age) & loved it. Now I'm Atticus' age & have raised children of my own, which lends a different perspective. Knowing the story ahead of time meant I could relax & the details really popped. Scout is quite the character. Precocious, she's often a square peg in a round hole. Her experience with learning in school resonated quite deeply with me. 
 The combination of Scout's 8 year old POV & the small town background complimented each other & made the subtext come alive brilliantly. The huge problems of the racial divide, prejudice, & poverty during the Depression were obvious, but the way Scout tried to sort the good from the bad in people was fantastic. She had some definite ideas on how things should be & was quite bewildered by the reality of what was. Can't say as I blame her - I still don't understand people. Most of what should be black & white is gray, though it trends to paler shades in Atticus' opinion, one that she & I didn't always share. He's a far better, more understanding man than I. 
 The wording was captivating. For instance, the book starts off with: 
 When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem... 
 That tells us so much, so fast. Only a child would make such a fine distinction in age & we know the narrator holds Jem in high regard or else he'd just be 12.5. 
 Our introduction to Calpurnia made me chuckle. 
 Calpurnia was something else again. She was all angles and bones; she was nearsighted; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard. Scout obviously doesn't place much importance on race as it is sometime before we get any clue as to Cal's race. Not until she speaks about old Mr. Radley & then we just know she's not white. That means she's different or has different rules to Scout only. 
 I remember operators fondly. As an only child with a busy mother & a perpetually absent father, I called them more than once for advice, so I got a real kick out this: 
 Eula May was Maycomb's leading telephone operator. She was entrusted with issuing public announcements, wedding invitations, setting off the fire siren, and giving first-aid instructions when Dr. Reynolds was away. 
 Or Scout's evaluation of her uncle's looks: 
 He and Aunty looked alike, but Uncle Jack made better use of his face: we were never wary of his sharp nose and chin. 
 Her comparison of one old biddy winding down like a pump-up organ: 
 I was reminded of the ancient little organ .... The last note would linger as long as there was air to sustain it. Mrs. Merriweather had run out of air, I judged, and was replenishing her supply while Mrs. Farrow composed herself to speak. 
 The characters were intriguing. Of course the focus was on discovering more about Boo & Atticus, but just what was Miss Maudie's story? She was some one I'd like to know more about. And the newspaperman, Mr. Underwood (perfect name) had a lot more bottom than showed most times. The sheriff & judge were good men, too. 
 Possibly my favorite scene was the one in front of the jailhouse. They did that well in the movie, too. You can find it here:

 Thanks to Florence for turning me on to it. 
 Anyway, great book, a must read, highly recommended & all that. If you haven't read it since you were forced to in school, by all means make some time now. I wish I hadn't waited so long. It's amazing how much more was there now than I remembered.","Tue Dec 18 06:11:03 -0800 2007","Tue Oct 21 18:01:10 -0700 2014","Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 -0800 2013","Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 -0800 2013",20,14

Some books paint such a vivid picture in your mind that you'll continue to visualise scenes in your mind's eye for weeks, months, maybe even years to come because the author somehow managed to engage your sense of wonder. This is an art, certainly, and an art that I feel is critical to write great, as opposed to simply good, novels. Harper Lee is an artist. 
 Authors can craft these visual responses to words in different ways. Some do it through excellent use of prose (Mervyn Peake), atmosphere and setting (Susannah Clarke), or humour (Neil Gaiman, Douglas Adams). Lee falls somewhere within the second category, but what I feel is most remarkable about her approach is her command over nostalgia. She manages to create a believable and, above all, romantic and nostalgic atmosphere as she reflects upon the childhood of Gene Louise ""Scout"" Finch - all the while keeping everything perfectly realistic. To me she captures the very essence of childhood. 
 This powerful setting sets the atmosphere for Lee's bildungsroman and lures the reader into its grasp without one really noticing. That is not to say that this book is, as some have claimed, an easy read. I felt the first 100 pages were a slog to get through, mainly because the plot seemingly wasn't going anywhere and not much was happening, but perhaps this was necessary in order to fully realise the atmosphere. As with all stories this was a compromise between setting, plot, and characters, and luckily the eventual result of this compromise was a satisfying one. 
 To Kill a Mockingbird is worth the read for its atmosphere and nostalgic meditations on childhood alone, but there is one particular reason I believe absolutely everyone will benefit from reading this book. That reason is called Atticus Finch. 
 John Greene called him the ""role model to end all role models"", and I couldn't agree more.","Wed Apr 08 01:57:30 -0700 2015","Fri May 15 03:48:25 -0700 2015","Fri May 15 05:27:35 -0700 2015","Wed Apr 08 00:00:00 -0700 2015",1,0

Also, I'm pretty sure in one or two literature classes we watched part of the movie because I can't forget a Gregory Peck, but I was never in a class that actually read it, which is really actually kind of striking to me. I focused on the Southern Gothic for goodness sake! *hides* 
 WHY I Chose to Read It: Because I was really embarrassed about the fact that I never had! With all the controversy last year, I found myself nodding along a lot, and I felt really bad about it. Also, apparently I some intention to read this because I put myself on the library hold list for Go Set A Watchman and promptly forgot that I did so (a thing I do a lot because my library system is huge and it takes forever for popular books to come in). My hold came in at the beginning of January and my first thought was ""Whoops, well, I probably should read To Kill A Mockingbird first."" 
 WHAT Makes It A Classic: I find it interesting when you look at contemporary reviews of Mockingbird versus more modern reviews. It makes me think a lot about the life of literature and reception of a work can change over time. I think in the end what gave Mockingbird it's staying power is its portrayal of a specific time and place. It cuts into harsh issues of racism, classism, injustice, etc and does it through the eyes of a relatively privileged child. We see her (and especially her brother's) awaken to these problems and the (often problematic) mistakes she makes navigating them in a way that not many books allow. I think it's important to have a book in the ""Classics"" cannon that tells children, sometimes you're wrong and sometimes adults are too. 
 WHAT I Thought of This Classic: This is a masterpiece. Pure and simple. This is one of those situations where my five stars are less ""I liked the story"" and more ""the writing is transformative."" The story itself is brutal and harsh in many ways, even, (dare I use the Southern Gothic convention?) grotesque, but it is also imbued with a slim sense of hope. and childishness because of the narrators place in the world. I found the use of perspective and sense of place particularly interesting. This storyline could have been a -fascinating- multi-pov story, but the way Lee uses Scout as the sole voice we are struck hard with a very specific person's point of view. I have a lot of thoughts on that which I will come back to at some other time. 
 WILL It Stay A Classic: I don't know what else to say other than, ""well, yeah."" I think there are many ways that the themes in this book could be mined in literature classes that (as far as I know, as I stated above, none of my lit classes ever actually read it) it's currently not, and these discussions could open up a lot of new avenues. We are far from done with this book.

It is commentary on the human psyche and the social prejudices prevalent in those times, especially in the southern states. 
 Killing a Mocking Bird is a sin, it symbolic of killing something that is innocent and harmless and wonderful. This theme is expressed over and over in this book in various events. Told in a simple narrative, it paints a clear picture of society where racial discrimination and gender inequality were prevalent. But feminism was trying to make a headway, as in seen by Scout's deep resentment of social etiquette amongst women. The women's fashion of those times subtly points to the latter. 
 The three years this book spans, we see the two main protagonists grow, and through their eyes we see the true nature of their correspondents change till, one incident strips away their masks forever. This hypocrisy leaves a deep impression on their minds and above all, it is this this hypocrisy that attributes to the loss of this innocence. 
 A mocking bird has been killed and it is only the aftermath that shows us the gruesome picture of society bared to all. It is only one man that dares to stand against it. And that is why, Atticus is symbolic of courage and bravery. 
 His courage may not be about fighting a war, or firing a gun, but it is a bravery ingrained in his nature that trumps all and triumphs always....if not in saving a man, then in winning his children's respect forever.","Sat May 19 09:10:56 -0700 2012","Sat May 19 09:37:06 -0700 2012","Sat May 19 09:37:06 -0700 2012","",1,0

I've seen clips of the movie and have ""seen"" a play production of it from a high school (but i honestly just didn't want to pay attention, i was kind of forced to go) but I knew in the back of my mind I'd get around to reading it SOMEDAY. But knowing what becomes of a character in the ""sequel"" (if you can really call it that) has just put me off from ever reading this at all. 
 I wonder if the use of this book as a required-reading novel in school will continue now, knowing what becomes of the characters in the sequel. So much of what I hear my friends remembering learning from it is kind of tarnished from the sequel. I don't know. 
 (view spoiler)[From an outsiders perspective, Atticus Finch's racism in the 1950's south when Go Set A Watchmen takes place makes sense. And look, just because Atticus defended a black man in the first book does not mean he didn't believe in segregation. Historically speaking, his racism in the second book is logical... but at the end of the day... it's a book. And not many people like to have someone they ""idolized"" in a sense be brought down. I don't know. The entirety of GSAW's publication in the first place was shady enough, but I honestly wonder if Harper Lee held off from publishing it was because she knew her characters had changed when writing TKAM.

 I hadn't read this book since high school, and WOW - I am so glad that I did. Harper Lee is an amazing writer and Atticus Fitch is truly one of the best characters of all time. I have never highlighted a book before or searched for things on my iPad, and this is a story that I couldn't help but highlight and take notes on, solely because I was moved by the use of the English language. Harper Lee's writing is such that you are transported to the 1930s, to a time of racial divide and to a time of small towns, lack of education, and poverty that rampant. 
 Her work is truly a study of not only the time period, but of the characters. Her character development is so strong that you are pulled in and either love or despise them throughout the story. Ones that really struck a chord with me were: 
 Atticus - he is truly the father, the man, the role model that everyone wants in their life. He parents with EXTREME patience, with understanding, and with a deep conviction between right and wrong. His tolerance knows no bounds and I am awed with him. I have a wonderful, wonderful, father but would love to have had Atticus be in my life as well. 
 Scout - gotta love her. She is given the freedom to be who she wants to be, to play games and run with her brother, to be a free spirit. Yet, she is quick to go back home, listen to and share things with her father, and cuddle up in his lap. She embodies all that I want in children - that innocence, the spunk, and the firm beliefs in what is good. 
 My other favorite characters were Miss Maudie (how could you NOT love her - especially after her comment during the missionary lunch?) and Calpurnia. I even started to like Aunty a little towards the end. 
 I am just in awe of this book. ABSOLUTELY makes my favorites list. I am awaiting Netflix's copy of the movie tomorrow. I remember vaguely that Gregory Peck is amazing as Atticus. Right now, I'm just going to go for the ""I've finished the most amazing book"" afterglow and pause before deciding my next book to read.","Sat Dec 24 23:27:04 -0800 2011","Fri Dec 30 16:01:51 -0800 2011","Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 -0800 2011","Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 -0800 2011",3,0

I don't need to sit here and tell you why it's such an amazing, important book, that's been done a thousand times, a thousand different ways. I missed out reading this in high school, but I'm pretty sure a massive percentage of the Western population did read this in school, so most people should already have an idea about how amazing and important this book is. 
 Having spent most of my life hearing about this book but never having a clear idea as to what it was about, here are some things I wasn't expecting: 
 *The narrator is an 6-8 year old girl (it takes place over a couple of years) 
 *Very little of the court case actually features in the story 
 *Most of the meat of the story- the real essay-worthy stuff- happens as subtext 
 *The model of white trash that was happening... they live down near the black people and never work, so we (the locals) all have to act like they're worth more than the black people (because, after all, they're white) but none of us believe they are. There's a lot of complicated stuff happening there. 
 *I would die for Atticus Finch. He could ask me to do anything and I would do it. He is one of the most interesting characters I have ever encountered. I hear he gets a rough shake in the second one, and I'm really interested in reading it, because I don't see him as like... the American Ideal that I think he gets slotted in to. He's a man who is ahead of his time, but there is only so far one person can go when he still lives in that time. Also lots of interesting stuff going on with him. 
 *The willing sacrifice of one minority on the alter of another. 
 This is where the book lost a star, for me. The part when Jem was 'explaining' rape cases didn't really bother me, because it was actually an interesting look at how childishly we have seen these things in the past. ""Basically if you're not beat to a pulp and, preferably, knocked unconscious, it wasn't rape."" It's a very adolescent definition, and, horrifically, it's one we as a society have used. Even the case itself didn't bother me, all sides were humanized enough that I could see how no one could win. I mean, cool motive, still murder, but yeah, everything is awful. The part I wasn't expecting was the narrator's blatant distaste for her own gender. And you can see it being built up in her by the people surrounding her (her brother always saying ""you're starting to act like a girl"" to shame her, and so on) until it reaches a place where she says something like ""They might drink, swear, gamble blah blah lists more sins, but men are still more comfortable than women."" And I know she's only 8 years old, but she's SO uncomfortable in her own skin, as a girl, that groups of ladies makes her want to run away. This never gets dealt with, beyond a really passing sort of ""hey, I think being a girl might be a lot of work and not about weakness after all"" at one point. 
 And then there was the time when someone died (look at me trying to avoid spoilers) and the ladies go back to their missionary lunch, and Scout tries to behave her best because, ""If Aunt Alexandra could be a lady at a time like this, then so could I."" And on the one hand, it's one of the few times when Scout sees Auntie's behavior in a positive light; it might be the only time when femininity is seen as strength. But it's such a... I don't know, two-faced reaction? Why IS she being a lady at a time like this? The human thing to do would be to mourn, but they can't, because the one who died isn't white, so they go on with the facade, and this is the femininity we have to be proud of? I don't know. It doesn't sit right. I'm also INTENSELY worried about Mayella, and very angry that none of those missionary ladies thought to seek her out and help her. 
 Anyway, it was disappointing that a book that was working so hard to show all people are people would also, both blatantly and in subtext, trod on another minority. And things like Scout's internal misogyny being so clearly built up by other people kind of make me wonder if Lee wasn't doing something purposeful with that, like she was with the racism, but the resolution was never made clear. I do love Aunt Alexandra though. I love that she wasn't a straight-up baddie/terrible mother figure. And I did love that when the boys were being dicks, Scout went and hung out with Miss Maudie. There WERE some excellent women in there, doing excellent things. It's just that, while the narrative clearly presents racism as a problem, the sexism remains confused. It is really interesting to see that internal misogyny being built by a culture that is so intensely sexist, but while the internal racism is being challenged, I don't see the same thing happening with the sexism. I BELIEVE with all my soul that there was an underlying purpose to all those gender issues, but believe with the same intensity that it was unfinished. 
 That was a MASSIVE tangent, and it makes it seem like I thought less of the whole than I did. I wish I didn't need that tangent, but I still LOVED the book. And I am SO curious to read her sequel when it comes out in like... 2 days.","Sun Jul 05 16:27:00 -0700 2015","Mon Jul 13 13:32:07 -0700 2015","Sun Jul 12 00:00:00 -0700 2015","Sun Jul 05 00:00:00 -0700 2015",1,0

 And it's good, of course it's good. (The trial is the gripping standout.) But I was also struck by what a Feelgood Book about Race for White People this is. It's so easy to identify with good, unprejudiced Atticus and Scout and feel revulsion towards the racist bad guys, who are all Very Racist and Very Bad. The black characters have almost no agency and the reader gets to be in on the irony of the townspeople condemning antisemitism while continuing to treat black people in Alabama the way they do -- but without being challenged into any kind of self-examination. It propagates that comfortable myth that once upon a time things were bad but we're all fine now. 
 It's the story of pre-civil rights America told by a white lady, a la The Help. And of course in large part, Harper Lee's writing about her own experiences, which I don't begrudge her.

 I know this is a total childhood favorite for many people--it's not for me? I enjoyed it when I read it as a youth but it didn't imprint on me the way some other plucky heroines did. (eg Anne of Green Gables.) 
 So, in anticipation of Watchman, I've noticed a lot of (white) people re-reading it and realizing that maybe it isn't the perfectly anti-racist book they remembered it being? Here's my hot take on that: a Southern white lady wrote it in the 1950s 
 So yeah, it is totally a story about a white girl learning an important lesson from the suffering of a black man, in a way that would feel extremely icky in a contemporary novel. (OK maybe not given the popularity of The Help......) But! I still really did enjoy the re-read, and Scout's voice is so strong and delightful. There's a lot of sharp cleverness here, and a lot of frank talk about race and class and coming of age in the south. 
 Also, I mean, yes Atticus is a great voice for justice blah blah blah but also he is a total dick to a rape/incest victim? (Who is, of course, in turn, being a total dick to a disabled black man.)

 Aside from that personal rant, I found most of these characters to be more caricatures of small town life rather than actual three dimensional people. I'm sure part of this comes from the weird narration of Scout-as-a-child and Scout-as-a-grown-woman, but if Junie B.

 This story begins as a child tale, in wich the brothers Jem and Scout play, go to school and take gifts from a strange men who put them inside a tree. Then the story change and star to talk about the father's job. 
 (view spoiler)[Atticus Finch is a lawyer who defends Tom Robinson, a black guy who is charged of rape a withe girl. This is looks really bad for Atticus and Tom,who try to prove Tom's inocence with all the posible froofs, they end up loosing the trial. (hide spoiler)] 
 In my opinion this is a good book, I need an effort to finish reading it, but I think it's a really important book for the time it was written, so it's a good reading.

And then it climaxed in the end. It was brilliant. 
 Atticus was so kind, brave and so tolerant. He was strong, he still kept moving forward when so many opposed him. Amazing father.

For some reason, I'd always classed To Kill a Mockingbird in amongst the Agatha Christie genre of murder mysteries - not that I've read those either - and didn't know enough about it for it to have piqued my interest. Now I've read it though, I can see what all the fuss is about, and it's not surprising that, despite being published in 1960, it was still the 65th best-selling book of all time in 2012. Beware of spoilers! 
 The story is set in Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930s, and is written from the perspective of Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch, who is between six and eight years old as the story progresses. The start of the book does an effective job of introducing us to all the characters. Scout lives with her widowed father, Atticus, a lawyer, her brother Jem (who is 4 years older than her) and Calpurnia, a black woman who acts as a type of mother figure. A friend, Dill, also joins them in the summer. The three children are intrigued by Arthur 'Boo' Radley, who lives in the house on the corner but is never seen outside. I really enjoyed this part of the story; it set the scene brilliantly, as well as helping me reminisce about my own childhood. Even if there is no 'haunted' house, children will always make one - at least, my brother and I did! With the limitless amounts of imagination children have, there will always be adventures to be had and 'monsters' to escape from. There was one particular house, when we were around the same age as Jem and Scout, where they had a doorbell you pulled, like a cord. My brother Josh said it was a doorbell that made you scream every time you pulled it, so we obviously had great fun in pulling it, screaming, and running away. If by some fluke the person living there is reading this, I'm really sorry, but it still makes me laugh! There was also every Christmas, when we went carol singing. We had decided that the houses beyond the wood were richer than the others, and every year would link arms, lighting matches to try and find our way in the dark and telling ghost stories the whole time. 
 Once everything has been established, the book moves on to a case Atticus is defending. A black man, Tom, has been accused of raping Mayella Ewell, part of a trashy white family with very poor education and even less money. This is where the casual prejudice of the time is evident - Jem and Scout have to put up with people calling their family a ""nigger-lover"" (sorry if that language offends, it is a direct quote and I mean no harm); Atticus faces repercussions for his whole-hearted attempt to save Tom; and many of the Maycomb women look down on the black community. However, there's still a touch of hope - the way Atticus defends Tom's case makes everybody think, a great feat in the setting where black and white people are in completely different classes. In this part of the story, I really looked up to Atticus, in his seemingly-infinite wisdom. 
 In the final part of the story, Jem and Scout finally get to meet Boo Radley, and it is here that the title of the book becomes apparent. In the middle of the book, after Jem and Scout get air-rifles, it is said: 
 When he gave us our air-rifles Atticus wouldn't teach us to shoot. Uncle Jack instructed us in the rudiments thereof; he said Atticus wasn't interested in guns. Atticus said to Jem one day, ""I'd rather you shoot at tin cans in the back yard, but I know you'll go after birds. Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."" 
 That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. 
 ""Your father's right,"" she said. ""Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."" 
 Obviously, not knowing what was coming, I thought the story must eventually be about the children shooting a mockingbird. The last page of the book, though, I realised that it was a lot more subtle and symbolic than that. The mockingjay is Boo Radley, the man who gives when he can and causes no harm. 
 I really wish I'd read this story as a child, to see what sort of perspective I'd have had back then. Reading as an adult means that, while Scout was a brilliant perspective, I was almost reading as an outsider. I could see her maturing, slowly fitting the pieces together to start acting like an adult, but at the same time it was an undeniably adult reading. I really really enjoyed the book, but I have a feeling it's one of those multi-faceted ones where you read something different every time. I can't help thinking that reading it as a child would have been a lot more powerful.

I wish my teacher had just said: this is what is really going on, but Scout just doesn't get it.

That jem and scout grow up to more appreciate him and his morality and beliefs in a wonderful journey to watch. The trial of Tom Robinson is doomed yet beautifully written and the guilty verdict, though no surprise, is like a bullet as you as a reader have dared to hope. Atticus' description of the mob outside the prison as humans is touching and the realisation of scout At the end that the murder of ewell being tried would be like the killing of a mockingbird is enlightened. 
 The story of a black mans journey through a rape charge- told through the eyes of white people and with a focus on how it effects them is also an effective political comment.

 I also love that Harper Lee's Atticus models a generous, pure heart.

He knew they were going to have some rough treatment due to his involvement in Tom Robinson's case, but instead of protecting them by turning his back, he did his best to prepare them for it, then did what he knew was right anyway. 
 Also his kindness and compassion for nearly all of his neighbors, from cranky Mrs. Dubose to Boo Radley, even to Mayella Ewell, was touching and inspiring.

 Yep. Still five stars. 
 1 June 2012 
 Just re-read this book for the second time. I love this book. I LOVE this book. This time around I really found that Lee was reminiscent of Mark Twain. It makes me think of growing up and summertimes in north west Florida. 
 I'm bumping it up a star. It was a great reminder of what I started law school for.

 I usually prefer to enjoy my reading material rather than having to parse it's deeper meaning, so I can sometimes be rather reluctant to read books that are critically acclaimed and/or considered classics, since they are often difficult to understand. I'd heard so many wonderful things about To Kill a Mockingbird that I finally decided to take a chance on it when it was chosen as a book club read for the GoodReads Readers Against Prejudice and Racism group of which I am a part. I was very pleasantly surprised at what an easy read it was, while at the same time conveying a deep and layered message, not only about prejudice but also about standing up for what's right, that I know will stay with me, probably for the rest of my life. Another astonishing thing about the book to me was the number of lighthearted if not downright funny moments it contained. This is something I never would have expected from a book that tackled such a serious and controversial issue for its time. In my opinion, Harper Lee is an amazing writer, and I was absolutely stunned to discover that To Kill a Mockingbird was the only novel she ever wrote. However, I suppose there's nowhere else to go once you've won the highest honor in the writing world, a Pulitzer Prize, and she certainly made her one shot count in a huge way. 
 Young Scout Finch is the first-person narrator of the story. She is only about six or seven when it opens, but more than two years pass by as Ms. Lee builds up to the penultimate events of the book, by which time Scout is nine years old. She is a tomboy who's as smart as a whip and a precocious reader. When her first grade teacher told her she had to stop reading because her daddy was teaching her all wrong and first-graders weren't supposed to read, I had to laugh. It was ludicrously funny but also a sad commentary on our educational system. I just loved Scout's enthusiasm for reading. She joked that her brother, Jem, said she was born reading and she couldn't remember a time when she couldn't read. In this way, Scout very much reminded me of myself. I thought it was fascinating how Scout, in her child's mind, thinks of her father as old, decrepit, and thoroughly boring. She doesn't think he has any real skills or has accomplished anything. It was an absolute joy to watch Scout's opinion of Atticus gradually grow and change as she matures and begins to see him in an entirely new light through, not only the big trial, but all the little things he does. 
 I loved Scout's relationship with her brother. She and Jem fight like siblings often do, but at the same time they were very close. I like how Jem is a little gentleman, always looking out for Scout. It was wonderful how closely he actually watches their father, and subtly emulates him. When their summertime friend and neighbor, Dill, gets in on the action, these three can get into lots of amusing mischief. Seeing the world through these kids eyes was a positively delightful experience. Dill is quite good at creating wild yarns. I just knew he was destined to be a writer someday;-) (for anyone who doesn't know Dill is patterned on Harper Lee's childhood friend and neighbor, Truman Capote). The lessons that the kids learn are deeply touching. Whether it's how they go from being scared of their reclusive neighbor Boo Radley to beginning to understand why he stays away from people; or learning from Mrs. Dubose, the cranky old lady who likes to hurl insults at them, that things aren't always as they seem; or the tough lessons they learned about injustice through Tom Robinson's trial, they are on a constant journey of discovery, both of the world around them and themselves that often brought tears to my eyes. 
 If I were Scout, I'd think that I had the best dad in the world, but since I'm much, much closer to Atticus's age than Scout's, I'd have to say that he has become my latest literary crush. He is just quite simply an amazing man. Some people think that he's a questionable father who lets his kids run wild, because he doesn't spank them and they have a tendency to speak their mind. To the contrary, I believe he was a man who led by quiet example, and showed his kids how to be good citizens by teaching them to think critically for themselves. I love how Atticus just naturally speaks with ""bigger"" words and doesn't dumb it down for his children, but instead allows them to ask for clarification if they don't understand something, always answering their questions with complete honesty. That's how I tend to be, and I think kids can learn more that way. Atticus is a very wise man who sees many facets to the world around him. He is a kind, loving, gentle soul who always seems to see the good in people. He's a true gentleman, a brilliant attorney, an honorable and humble man who fights for what's right no matter what. If more men were like Atticus Finch, the world, without a doubt, would be a much better place. 
 To Kill a Mockingbird is another of those books which sadly, over fifty years after its release, is still found at the top of the ALA's most banned/challenged books list. It does contain some profanities, mostly mild, but a couple of more moderate ones including taking the Lord's name in vain twice. There is also a number of instances where the derogatory ""n"" word is used for African Americans, but given the time and setting of the book, it never seemed overdone or out of place to me. There is also the mature subject matter of a black man being wrongly accused of raping a white girl, but since it is all told through the eyes of a nine year-old child, everything has a certain air of innocence to it, with nothing ever really being spelled out explicitly. In spite of this potentially objectionable content, I still feel that the book is fully appropriate for high school level students. In my opinion, the positive role model that Atticus presents and the positive messages contained within the book's pages, far outweigh any possible detractors. I personally think it would be an absolute travesty to ban a book as thought-provoking as this one, and in fact, would encourage everyone, teens and up, to read it at least once. 
 I'm so glad I finally picked up To Kill a Mockingbird. The courtroom scenes were extremely well-written and appear to reflect Ms. Lee's personal experience with the law. Some parts of the story were a little slow at times, but never boring and always worth the wait for something more exciting to happen. Every character and every little side story added flavor, color and depth to this wonderful tale. The message it conveys is a timeless one. It is one of the most, if not the most, affecting book I've ever read centering around the themes of prejudice and racism. To Kill a Mockingbird has without a doubt earned a spot on my keeper shelf and has become a new all-time favorite book for me.","Sat Jan 09 20:45:24 -0800 2010","Fri Dec 14 13:34:50 -0800 2012","Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 -0700 2011","Thu Jun 09 00:00:00 -0700 2011",9,13

 Well, I can definitely see why it did. This is a story of a loving father trying to teach his children how to be true to themselves while living in a time that fiercely involved race, class and gender issues on a daily basis. What I enjoyed mostly about this story was how it was narrated by a child. You get to, experience through their eyes, their innocence and their growth throughout the story.

Harper Lee constructs an interesting kind of tension by focalizing the novel through the pre-teen girl, who narrates the story, and who learns of the case against Tom Robinson from her father, who is counsel for the defense. An additional tension is supplied by a subplot in which the narrator and her brother speculate about the reclusive and mysterious Boo Radley; the crimes they imagine him having committed gives the reader an additional perspective on how children interpret and understand the violence of the world of adults.

 I had issues with some of the words (I know that was the way the spoke back the then but) one word is ""yonder""! every time is saw the word I considered pausing which was almost every page.

Maybe I'm not getting something, but everything Lee does thematically was done much, much better by Steinbeck and O'Connor. Her writing is fine, but not particularly remarkable compared to other great, American 20th century novelists.
